# The version number is what follows the word "version" in the title.
# PDF_VERSION should be passed as an environment variable, but will
# default to 0.1.0 if not present.
# An easy way to specify it at runtime would be to run:
# PDF_VERSION=v0.3.0 make
PDF_VERSION ?= "0.1.0"

# The rule is "pdf-preamble" not "pdf-preamble.yaml" because we don't
# want it to refuse to rebuild the .yaml file when that file appears
# to be up-to-date relative to "pdf-preamble.yaml.in" -- we're more
# likely to update rule inputs in this Makefile than in the .in file.
# Also, yes, there is a 'sed' command in the 'sed' command below :-).

# We want intra-document links to work in both GitHub
# and in the PDF.  This is complicated because on
# GitHub, cross-file links should specify both the
# destination file and the anchor in that file, like...
# 
# [Adoptability Module](adoptability.md#adoptability-assessment)
# 
# ...while in the PDF, we don't want the filename, because
# there are no file boundaries within the PDF: everything is
# combined in to one giant Markdown input, and the only thing
# that matters within that input is anchor names.
# 
# (By the way, remember that anchor names are usually
# calculated from the Markdown section titles; it's rare that
# we explicitly write an anchor name as such in the source
# text.)
# 
# Our solution is to automatically pre-process that giant
# combined-Markdown input before handing it off to pandoc
# for conversion to PDF.  Specifically, we convert, e.g.,
# 
# [Adoptability Module](adoptability.md#adoptability-assessment)
# 
# to
# 
# [Adoptability Module](#adoptability-assessment)
# 
# That's what the 'sed' expression below does :-).
# 
# Note that this means we need unique anchor names across the
# whole project.  For example, we can't have a subsection
# named "## Resources" in one file and a section with the
# exact same name in another file, because Markdown would
# create two anchors both named "#resources", and that anchor
# name would then be non-unique within the combined PDF.
