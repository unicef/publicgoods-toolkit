This list will surely be incomplete, as technology innovation is
dynamic and open approaches are being refined in new DPG use cases.</p><p>We look forward to <a href="https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your
recommendations</a>
of new resources and tools you&#x27;ve found particularly useful in your
DPG project!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="resources-and-tools-introduction">Resources and Tools: Introduction<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#resources-and-tools-introduction" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p><strong>Engaging Open Source Networks</strong></p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: It would be great to offer some information here on
how to find associations or networks for open source, and how to
access global networks if local ones are not strong yet.  There are so
many resources out there.  Note that in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/#introduction">introduction</a>, we already offer the
advice to look in <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a> for
some suggestions on this.  In Europe, there is the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source
Observatory</a>.
But it would be good to present similar resources for Africa, South
America, India, and Southeast Asia.</p><p>You might also start by connecting with your local university,
especially if there&#x27;s a computer science or data science program.
Open source and open data are also heavily relied upon in other
disciplines, like physics and public policy programs and business
schools.  <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/the-transformative-role-of-academia-digital-public-goods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHIS2&#x27;s early focus on building academic and regional
networks</a>
is a great example here.  Academic institutions are another source of
useful national and international networks.  You&#x27;re also likely to
find talent and support at any sort of commercial start-up accelerator
or incubator, which if not physically local might still be accessible
and helpful to you online.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Open Source</strong></p><ul><li><p>The World Bank report <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source for Global Public
Goods</a>
(2019) gives an overview of the benefits of open source, along with
sensible operational advice -- especially for those working in
resource-constrained environments -- and a few case studies around
Identification for Development (ID4D).  It reiterates many of the
same points we note here, such the benefits of open APIs and a
modular architecture.</p></li><li><p>Benefits are also highlighted in the article <a href="https://www.publicsectorexecutive.com/Public-sector-focus/open-source-software-finds-its-sweet-spot-in-the-public-sector-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Software
Finds its Sweet Spot in the Public

listed as a DPG itself, &quot;gives public organizations a model for
building their own open-source solutions to enable successful future
reuse by similar public organizations in other places.  It includes
guidance for policy makers, city administrators, developers and
vendors.&quot; It lists straightforward tips, from how to welcome new
contributors to the importance of maintaining version control, and
also includes links to good additional resources.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Source Code

Code.gov team to produce &quot;how to&quot; documentation pertaining to
federal source code and open-source software.  It provides guidance
to agencies for creating and maintaining federal source code
inventories and open-source repositories.  It&#x27;s a mix of high-level
and very specific tips and includes links to good additional
resources.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="resources-and-tools-community">Resources and Tools: Community<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#resources-and-tools-community" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p><strong>Project Archetypes</strong></p><p>This <a href="https://opentechstrategies.com/files/presentations/2018-finos/finos-presentation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 slide presentation of project
archetypes</a>
is a useful short summary of the concept.  Use your keyboard arrows to
move through the slides.</p><p><strong>Community Health</strong></p><p>Mozilla, the non-profit managed company behind the Firefox web browser
and other open, web-focused products, recently published a <a href="https://report.mozilla.community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report on
its numerous, varied contributor
communities</a> (see the .pdf version).
This report posits a vision for comprehensively understanding
open-source health, following a rather academic approach called the
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261715766_Measuring_the_Health_of_Open_Source_Software_Ecosystems_Beyond_the_Scope_of_Project_Health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization
(OSEHO) framework</a>,
and applies an
abbreviated version across its main communities.  The network analysis
visualizations in this report are particularly powerful.</p><p>For those who want to go deeper into community health, we recommend a review of
this OSHEO framework.
Talking through the paper&#x27;s understanding of broader project ecosystems -- noting
that project health does not necessarily equate with ecosystem health -- can be
particularly useful to teams looking to build an open-source product whose
success in adoption and contribution depends on a broader ecosystem. </p><p><strong>Creating your own open-source community</strong></p><p>There&#x27;s a rich set of online materials about how to create and nurture
a thriving open-source community.  Some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><p>The EU&#x27;s <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Guidelines%20for%20Sustainable%20OSS%20Communities%20in%20the%20Public%20Sector%20final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the
Public
Sector</a>
(2020).  This aligns with the recommendations covered here, from a
needs and readiness assessment to planning for long term
sustainability.  It also includes a lits of key considerations to
building your own open-source community.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://producingoss.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free
Software Project</a> reviews
the nuts and bolts of starting an open-source project, as does the
TODO Group&#x27;s <a href="https://todogroup.org/guides/starting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting an Open Source
Project</a>.  RedHat&#x27;s

is another general guide that also includes a &#x27;Community 101&#x27;
primer.

Series</a>
includes some particuarly useful tips about understanding and
building to contributor types, or personas.  Remember, your
community is not necessarily all about coding!  Community members
can write documentation, localize content, answer questions and
provide product support (Mozilla&#x27;s product support is largely
volunteer-driven), help you market the product or service, and more.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://opensource.guide/building-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Guide to Building Welcoming Open Source
Communities</a> does just
what the title suggests and dives more deeply into some of the
niceties around community building (and includes guides to related
topics like governance and leadership).  The TODO Group has
published a similar guide, <a href="https://todogroup.org/guides/diversity-inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building an Inclusive Open Source
Community</a>.</p></li><li><p>Crowdsourcing data collection can also require attention to
community development and management, such as for volunteers
collecting data or managing other data preparation and maintenance
tasks.  In order to help its volunteer communities around languages
and voice data grow quickly and independently, the open-source, open-data
project Common Voice published a <a href="https://common-voice.github.io/community-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x27;community
playbook&#x27;</a>.  This
guidance helps Mozilla track data collection around the globe and
ensure high quality while letting independent, local efforts grow
without much centralized control.</p><p>Unfortunately, participants in online communities exhibit the same
destructive behavior we see in the physical world.  Marginalized,
vulnerable community members are most frequently targeted.  Clear
community participation guidelines can help fend off some of these
behaviors, and their <em>enforcement</em> builds trust within a community.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla&#x27;s Community Participation Guidelines
(CPG)</a>
is a great model to consider copying for your own open-source
project.  Mozilla&#x27;s CPG is based on existing best practices and a
good amount of hands-on experience and research into creating more
inclusive contributor communities.  Note that it includes a clear
structure for reporting problematic community behavior and what to
expect as part of this process.</p></li><li><p>The DPG OpenMRS has a good <a href="https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/OpenMRS+Code+of+Conduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code of
conduct</a>
that they adapted from the Ubuntu open-source project.  <a href="https://report.mozilla.community/assets/report/Mozilla-Rebel-Alliance-Report-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla&#x27;s
2020 analysis of its contributor
communities</a>
also provides insight into how to support diversity and inclusion.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, the freely available and widely adopted <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor
Covenant</a> code of conduct has
been translated into almost three dozen languages.</p></li></ul><p>Don&#x27;t be put off by the thorough guides we cite above and feel that
managing an open-source project requires significant investment in
community development and governance.  Deep investment isn&#x27;t necessary
for every project type.  For those where it makes sense, you should
approach community development in phases and &#x27;right size&#x27; investment
to what&#x27;s needed.</p><p>For example, the DPG <a href="https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIAgro&#x27;s machine learning
algorithms</a> are available on
GitHub, with a simple overview of their project on that makes it clear
what they plan to work on, how to contribute, and how to join the
community discussion on Discourse.  If we had to peg this as an
archetype, it&#x27;s probably most akin to the Rocketship to Mars type.  They&#x27;re
open to anyone participating, but they&#x27;re unlikely to invest in bringing people
onbaord unless they are clearly aligned and have needed skills. They are following
open-source best practices in order to create trust around their product, but
they don&#x27;t need to build for a broader
mass audience.</p><p>As another example, the DPG Primero created a <a href="https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/946/file/Primero.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global, inter-agency
governance
structure</a>
only when the platform had matured enough to merit such formalized
oversight.  The OpenSRP DPG publishes a very readable, straightforward
<a href="https://smartregister.org/governance-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of how its governance, contribution process, and community
management work</a>.</p><p>For those projects that are mature or require significant community
development and would thus benefit from a community manager, note also
that a community manager&#x27;s role can be more broadly defined to include
adjacent work like documentation, running trainings, and managing key
partners, as well as typical community management tasks like ensuring
new contributors can find appropriate work to do.  For an example, see
a <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/join-our-team/project-community-engagement-coordinator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent job posting for a community
manager</a>
from the the team behind the Kobo Toolbox DPG (accessed Sept. 2021).</p><p><strong>Clear guidance around <em>how</em> to contribute and what the project is looking
for with contributions</strong> is as important as community governance and management.<br>
<!-- -->The UNICEF Innovation team maintains a <a href="https://github.com/unicef/inventory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public repository of best practices and

and managing digital public goods that includes some tips on how to write good
contributor guidelines to help direct participants into your project&#x27;s particular
needs and workflow. It also includes some tips on documentation, which, again, is
another area for community contribution.</p><p><strong>Regarding external financing, the <a href="https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guidelines_funding_OSS.pdf%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guidelines for Funding Open

mind</strong> and will give you a good sense of what many funders are likely
to look for in a proposal that includes open-source software

practical recommendations in this paper, but you might still benefit
from glancing at this as you plan for your DPG.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="resources-and-tools-policy">Resources and Tools: Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#resources-and-tools-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p><strong>Integrated Policy Approaches</strong></p><p>The World Bank pubished a background paper <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/165711456838073531-0050022016/original/WDR16BPEstonianeGovecosystemVassil.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estonian e-Government

trademark policies and additional readings. We particularly like the Linux Foundation&#x27;s
tips on how to create a trademark program to encourage compatibile, &#x27;conforming&#x27;
products. (Note that conforming does not automatically equate with certification,
which requires
an higher level of scrutiny and testing and -- for most jursicitions - an additional
set of legal requirements).</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>It&#x27;s a given truth -- unfortunately borne out by real world evidence
-- that computing systems can never be fully secure.  This is true not
only becuase of how software (and hardware) works but also because of
the economics of the IT industry, misaligned incentives and
externalities, little liability for vendors, human nature, the
complexity of today&#x27;s systems, and so much more.  <em>Secrets and Lies:
Digital Security in a Networked World</em> (2000), by renouned security
expert Bruce Schneier, is a good dive into why security is hard.  The
OECD&#x27;s recent report, <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/understanding-the-digital-security-of-products_abea0b69-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding the digital security of products:
An in-depth
analysis</a>,
provides a timely overview of the &quot;dynamics that shape the digital
security of products in various markets&quot;, especially the dynamics
across the value chain behind digital products.  It also outlines
suggested responses for policy makers, some of which make sense at an
agency level.  It&#x27;s an excellent paper and recommended reading.</p><p>The paper <a href="https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/publications/threats-risks-mitigations/v1.1/Threats%2C%20Risks%2C%20and%20Mitigations%20in%20the%20Open%20Source%20Ecosystem%20-%20v1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threats, Risks, and Mitigations in the Open Source
Ecosystem</a>
is a great overview of how to think about security from the
perspective of an open-source ecosystem (here, they use ecosystem to
describe the set of things that comprise a specific open-source
project, such as developers, end users, technical architecture, and
package libraries).</p><p>Regarding the ongoing conversation over security and open source
versus closed source, we like David Wheeler&#x27;s much noted
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay</a>.
Bruce Schneier has also <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/open-source-does-not-equal-secure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written frequently on the same

Across UNDP Programming and
Operations&quot;</a>
is a useful reference, aimed at helping its programming and
operational staff manage risk across the UNDP enterprise.</p><p>Lastly, some thoughts on <strong>cultural and security considerations when coding in
the open</strong>.</p><p>It&#x27;s important to think through the cultural shifts required for an
open project to succeed.  Regulation, policies and processes can set
the boundaries of an environment and influence behaviour, but the
execution is still up to individual human choice.</p><p>open-source co-development often requires new tools and processes, and
that change must be supported by the organization&#x27;s culture.  At its
heart, open-source collaboration requires communicating and coding in
the open.  This transparency brings the benefits outlined throughout
this document, but it also opens the project -- and its human
participants -- to feeling vulnerable to more criticism and being
called out more easily for mistakes.  open-source collaboration can be
a significant change for a team or organization (recall our
recommendation to consider if there is a low-risk project you can take
on as an &#x27;primer&#x27; open-source experiment!).  Recognize that change
feels like a loss to many -- a loss of stability and what they knew
about how to work -- and they will need leadership and guidance.  Be
sure to keep conversations going in your team about how well your
organizational culture supports their needs.</p><p>One of the greatest fears of many developers is to jeopardize a
project&#x27;s security and potentially harm real people.  Many might worry
that open-source code is itself a security vulnerability.  What if a
mistake is made in the open? How can an agency decide what code should
stay proprietary because of security concerns?</p><p>The UK government has publicly wrangled with these issues and come up
with useful guidance.  It&#x27;s notable that their stance on how much code
to develop through an open-source model has changed from &quot;most&quot; to
&quot;all, with very limited exceptions&quot;.  In short, their experience
taught them that open sourcing code was actually a great way to
confirm and enhance security, perhaps even particularly for code
related to managing security.  When following and enforcing <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong
security
design</a>,
such as ensuring configuration files are kept separately from code,
they found that open peer review improves security.</p><p>The UK&#x27;s guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security Considerations When Coding in the
Open</a>
is a concise, clear checklist for developers and program managers that
links to other useful resources, such as how to manage software
dependencies and the value of automated style enforcement.  These
checklist items include:</p><ul><li>Open the code early</li><li>Don&#x27;t rely on closed code as your only security measure</li><li>Follow good development practices</li><li>Keep keys and credentials closed</li><li>Assume accidental publications are compromised</li><li>Deal with security vulnerabilities</li></ul><p>Their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approach to when code should be kept
closed</a>
is similarly straightforward:</p><ul><li>Data and code related to keys and credentials</li><li>Algorithms used to detect fraud</li><li>Unreleased policy should be kept closed</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="resources-and-tools-adoptability">Resources and Tools: Adoptability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#resources-and-tools-adoptability" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Maturity

another way of evaluating an open-source product for adoption.  It
covers the same points we review in the paper, but it has more of a
process-oriented approach that also includes scoring and weighting.
