# Appendix: Sample Contract Language 

This appendix provides a sample statement of work around Open Source Quality Assurance practices
as well as sample contract language around security and data
protection.


## Sample Contract Language: Open Source Quality Assurance 

Below is an example **Statement of Work** for an open-source project that includes points around Open Source Quality Assurance (OSQA). 

**Overview**

Following the open-sourcing of Software, Vendor proposes to assist Client State to:

- Monitor and improve deployability: Monitor and advise on Software's deployability by other jurisdictions; improve Software's deployability as needed.
- Improve deployment process: Analyze, improve, and document Software's deployment process.
- Manage third-party contributions: Help manage code contributions and other contributions from third-party contributors.
- Assist with public communications: Help inform governments and the civic technology community about Software's availability and capabilities.
- Plan and advise on long-term maintenance: Help find or create an appropriate long-term home for the Software source code and related assets, to support long-term maintenance while also ensuring that State's needs with respect to Software continue to be met.  This involve forming or joining a consortium.
- Develop open-source contracting and procurement language: See description below.
- Advise on open source / open technology processes: See description below.
- Hackathons / Events: Organize and/or assist in organizing hackathons and other events to promote actionable interest in Software.

This proposed Statement of Work describes mainly ongoing processes. Although each process will likely have specific deliverables associated with it, not all of those deliverables can be predicted in advance. Therefore, this SOW proposes activities with time boundaries, not with the intention of ending the work when the time limit is reached, but to give State a scheduled checkpoint to assess the quality and direction of the work so far, with the option to extend and/or amend the contract if desired.

**Assistance Areas**

Monitor and improve deployability

Vendor will regularly monitor the deployability of the Software code and sample data, both by self-deployments and by maintaining regular contact with other parties attempting to deploy Software in real-world environments.  Where possible, Vendor will seek to improve Software's deployability. Maintaining easy deployability is crucial in Software's success, not only in jurisdictions outside State but, in the long run, even for State itself.  Ease of deployability ultimately means not only ease of adoption, but faster turnaround times on bug reports, greater flexibility in live deployment options, and expanded ability for others to participate in release testing.

It is typically somewhat difficult for a primary vendor who controls the live production environment to monitor generic deployability effectively. There are too many pressures on that vendor to focus all effort on deployability for the specific case of the primary client's data in that client's environment – even though in the long run, improved general deployability also results in improved deployability for the production environment too.  Vendor thus proposes to serve as an independent third party, ensuring that deployability standards are maintained.

Improve deployment process

Ease and standardization in Software's deployment process are crucial for Software adoption.  The first step for any other jurisdiction interested in Software is to stand up a test instance with their own data; without a reliable, well-documented data-import and deployment process, this first step will continue to be a major hurdle.

Vendor will perform technical analysis and make technical and documentation improvements as needed to ensure that deployment is manageable for a wide range of jurisdictions and vendors.

Manage third-party contributions

Many aspects of managing incoming open-source contributions (core code, documentation, sample data, third-party deployment scripts, bug reports, etc) do not require deep technical expertise in the software.  Vendor proposes to handle, as an ongoing process, the parts of contribution management than can be separated from in-depth code review and technical decision-making.  State and Vendor would of course still make final decisions about what contributions to accept, and how, but Vendor would take care of the entry-level open-source project management bureaucracy as much as possible, including but not necessarily limited to:

- Day-to-day communications with participants in the project's open-source forums;
- First-pass review of contributions, to ensure proper formatting, description (log message), etc;
- First-pass review of public bug reports, to have initial dialogue with the reporter, resolve duplicates, make sure proper reproduction recipes are included, answer common questions, spot trends in the user community, etc.
- Monitoring of the public discussion forums, to make sure the right parties are talking to each other, to help gather a formal knowledge base (e.g., FAQ) about the software, and to flag important items for State and/or Vendor's attention
- Management of Contributor License Agreements, to make sure the project can legally and safely accept the contribution;
- Management of contributors in GitHub;
- Management of public-facing documentation, to the extent that deep technical knowledge of Software is not required (which we anticipate being a fairly broad extent);
- Coordinate with Vendor on contributions that are being accepted into the core code for general release, to make sure that the internal development process is plugged into the public forums in ways the community can use.

We believe that this semi-separable part of contribution management is probably more than half of the typical public engagement overhead of running an open-source project – speaking roughly, somewhere between 70% and 75% of that overhead.  Having Vendor handle this portion would allow Vendor to concentrate on technical review and on just the communications that directly involve core code or State-desired features, and maximize the project's ability to get the full advantage of public engagement, which, if done right, far outweighs the overhead.  Vendor would of course remain free to become as involved with public technical engagement as they wish to be & have the bandwidth to be, and Vendor would fully support them in this.

Assist with public communications

Running an open-source project with a primary stakeholder of State's size inevitably involves moments when messaging (about the inclusion or exclusion of a core feature, for example) must be done in a careful and well-considered manner, in ways that will be comprehensible by both the open-source and civic technology communities – including government officials and other vendors.

There are more and less successful ways to send such messages.  The more successful ones leave all stakeholders feeling confident about the project and its future (even if their particular concern or bug was not addressed, or even was exacerbated).  The less successful ones leave some stakeholders feeling uncertain, and possibly reconsidering their involvement or their adoption of the software.  Vendor proposes to assist with such public communications, taking an advisory role in both drafting and reviewing them, in helping to determine which forums and media to broadcast such messages in, and in managing responses to incoming communications.

Plan and advise on long-term maintenance

The Software's long-term maintenance may involve participation by multiple cities and vendors.  Vendor proposes to help State determine the best shape for this long-term maintenance structure and, depending on the outcome of that process, help to set it up.  This will involve discussions with State as well as with with vendors such as [...], open technology consortia and organizations such as [...], and others.

Vendor will provide both structural advice, negotiation help, and, if necessary, legal assistance in setting up or joining such a body, in such a way as to ensure that State's interests are protected along with the long-term health of the Software code.  We emphasize that the success of any such consortium-based maintenance plan depends much more on the technical success and adoption of Software itself than on the particular arrangement of the consortium: no shared maintenance effort can succeed if the software itself is not successful, while even a flawed shared maintenance arrangement can still succeed quite well if the software is fundamentally healthy and in demand.

Develop open-source contracting and procurement language

Vendor will work with State to collect and analyze (from an open-source development perspective) the State's experiences in the Software's procurement and development contract, and suggest language or process improvements that could help build open-source practices into Software and future software projects from the start, in a way compatible with State's existing procurement procedures.

Advise on open-source / open-technology processes

During the phase leading up to the open sourcing, we discovered that various unforeseen questions related to open-source processes and technology tend to arise.  Their exact topics and timing at least cannot be reliably predicted (for example, in the couple of weeks immediately prior to this draft SOW, we discussed open-source databases and deployment procedures in some depth, security audit contracting & timing, and other things).  However, statistically, the overall rate and complexity of the questions is somewhat predictable, so we propose to simply budget for it explicitly in phase two.

Hackathons / Events

Vendor will assist State in determining what developer-oriented events (such as hackathons) would be most effective in promoting Software usage and adoption, and as appropriate organize or assist in organizing those events, including promotion, management of the event itself, and post-event results processing.

The current Statement of Work calls for one hackathon, in Fiscal Year 2019, covering both Software core development and API development.  It is possible that two hackathons (perhaps one focusing just on API usage, and another on both core and API) would be a good investment, and/or that events other than hackathons could benefit Software, but in any case we would still recommend that they happen in FY 2019.  Such events do better the more potential attendees there are already familiar with the technology in question and the longer that technology has been publicly available and discussed.  In both respects, Software will be in a better position for such events in FY 2019 than in FY 2018.

## Sample Contract Language: Security and Data Protection 

The EU publishes a modular set of GDPR-compliant [Sample Standard
Contractural
Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en)
that cover data transfers between EU and non-EU countries.  These
documents include sections on data protection safeguards, use of
subprocessors, redress, liability, and more.  The EU also provides a
template [data processing
agreement](https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement), [privacy
notice](https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/), and [right to erasure
form](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-erasure-request-form/).

Note that you'll often hear the terms data processing agreement and
data protection addendum used interchangably.  They serve the same
purpose.

Below, you'll find somewhat simpler sample contract language covering
key data protection (not completely GDPR compliant) and security
procedures issues.  These examples aren't comprehensive to all
situations and needed areas of coverage, and there are some US-centric sections 
(e.g. references to SSAE‐16/SOC‐1), but they 
are still useful
guidance as you draft your own contracts with vendors.  We include
this template because of its more in-depth security requirements,
which, again, may or may not be relevant to your situation.

While this sample contract language is provided under the Creative Commons

to the content below and not to the personal identity of the author or to any 
identification or branding utilized by the author's law firm, Eckert Seamans.


***Disclaimer*** *: The following clauses are examples of actual data protection
 clauses used in technology agreements, adapted to remove any identifying information 
 regarding the providers or customers. Use and final language of the following 
 clauses must be modified to be appropriate for any specific software or service 
 being provided by a licensor, vendor or service provider. Such clauses should 
 not be used without advice from a lawyer familiar with technology agreements 
 and data protection issues. Close attention must also be paid to any disclaimer 
 or limitation of liability clauses, which may undermine the effectiveness of 
 remedies related to any breach by any licensor, vendor or service provider of 
 its contractual obligations.*

**Short and Concise Data Protection Clause**:

**Data Protection**. Licensor acknowledges that it may have access to certain of 
Licensee's computer and communications systems and networks for the purposes set 
forth in this Agreement. If any data is made available or accessible to Licensor, 
its employees, agents or contractors, pertaining to Licensee's business or financial 
affairs, or to Licensee's projects, transactions, clients or customers, Licensor 
will not store, copy, analyze, monitor or otherwise use that data except for the 
purposes set forth in the License Agreement for the benefit of Licensee. Licensor 
will comply fully with all applicable laws, regulations, and government orders 
relating to personally identifiable information ("PII") and data privacy with 
respect to any such data that Licensor receives or has access to under the License 
Agreement or in connection with the performance of any services for Licensee. 
Licensor will otherwise protect PII and will not use, disclose, or transfer across 
borders such PII except as necessary to perform under the License Agreement or as 
authorized by the data subject or in accordance with applicable law. To the extent 
that Licensor receives PII related to the performance of the License Agreement, 
Licensor will protect the privacy and legal rights of Licensee's personnel, 
clients, customers and contractors.

__________________________________________

**Comprehensive Data Protection Clauses (Including Exhibit Language)**:

**Customer Data and Intellectual Property**. All right, title, and interest in 
Customer Data (as defined below) will remain the property of Customer. Licensor 
has no intellectual property rights or other claim to Customer Data that is 
hosted, stored, or transferred to and from the Products or the cloud services 
platform provided by Licensor, or to Customer's Confidential Information. Licensor 
will cooperate with Customer to protect Customer's intellectual property rights 
and Customer Data. Licensor will promptly notify Customer if Licensor becomes 
aware of any potential infringement of those rights in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement.

**Security and Data Protection**.

1.0 Customer Data and Security. 

All Customer Data that will be hosted by Licensor 
under this Agreement will be hosted at data centers maintained and operated by 
[insert name] located in [insert location address or addresses] (the " Data 
Centers" ). For purposes of this Agreement and the Exhibits attached hereto 
"Customer Data" shall include any Customer Confidential Information, and any 
personally identifiable information relating to any customers, end users or 
employees of Customer, its suppliers or contractors (" Personal Data"), to which 
Licensor has or may have access in connection with the operation or administration 
of Licensor's platform, or in connection with the performance of Professional 
Services by Licensor for Customer under this Agreement or any applicable 
Statement(s) of Work. All Customer Data stored or at rest in the Data Centers, 
or in transport, will be encrypted in transport and will not be transferred to 
any other hosting entity or location without the prior written consent of Customer.

Licensor will provide the following available services and functions as part of 
the Software without additional cost: (i) the use of encryption technology to 
protect Customer Data from unauthorized access; and (ii) routine back‐up and 
archiving of Customer Data. Licensor will comply with the requirements of Exhibit __ 
(Data Security) and implement the Data Safeguards set forth in this Section, and 
Licensor will further implement reasonable security standards that it determines

physical security of the Data Centers used to maintain Customer Data; and (ii) 
Licensor's network, all operating systems and software applications, and all data 
storage systems and media provided by Licensor or its licensors or contractors, 
or operated or provided by Customer that connect or interface with Licensor's 
Products, Software or platform, from being subject to any Disabling Devices (as 
defined in Exhibit __ (Data Security) attached to this Agreement).

2.0 Data Safeguards. 

Licensor has represented to Customer that Licensor will not 
be permitted to access Customer Data stored or contained in the Products or 
Licensor's platform, and Licensor will have no ability to manipulate, modify or 
control such Customer Data. If any support services or Professional Services 
provided by Licensor may involve Licensor or its personnel having or requiring 
access to Customer servers, Customer applications, and/or Customer Data, Licensor 
\shall comply with the provisions of this Section and Exhibit __ (Data Security) 
attached hereto, and, at Customer's request, Licensor shall enter into an appropriate 
separate agreement with Customer to govern such access and protect any Customer 
Data that may be subject to such access. To the extent Customer grants Licensor 
access to Customer Data, or Licensor has access to or stores or holds any Customer 
Data, Licensor agrees to:
(i) access and use the Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing Customer 
with access to the Products, Software and Licensor's platform, and to provide 
Professional Services to Customer in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement and any applicable Statement(s) of Work;

unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is accessible to or held by Licensor 
("Data Safeguards"); and
(iii) not disclose the Customer Data to any third party, except: (x) to its 
employees, consultants or contractors who need to have access to such information 
and solely for purposes of providing Professional Services to Customer, provided 
that such recipients are bound by confidentiality provisions no less restrictive 
than those set out in this Agreement; and (y) to the extent required by a judicial 
order or other legal obligation, provided that, to the fullest extent permitted 
by law, Licensor will promptly notify Customer of such a required disclosure to 
allow intervention by Customer (and will cooperate with Customer) to contest or 
minimize the scope of the disclosure.

3.0 SOC 1/SSAE 16 Certification. 

Licensor 
will, on at least an annual basis, hire a third party auditing firm to perform a 
Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 audit, or 
equivalent audit, on internal and external Licensor procedures and systems that 
access or contain Customer Data. Licensor shall adhere to SOC 1/SSAE 16 audit 
compliance criteria and data security procedures (or any successor report of a 
similar nature that is generally accepted in the industry and utilized by Licensor), 
applicable to Licensor.

Licensor's security procedures will materially conform to the description thereof 
set forth in this Agreement and in attached Exhibit __ (Data Security), and as 
further described in Licensor's most recently completed SOC 1/SSAE 16 audit report 
(or any successor report of a similar nature that is generally accepted in the 
industry and utilized by Licensor). Upon Customer's request, Licensor will provide 
Customer with a copy of the audit results set forth in Licensor's SOC 1/SSAE 16 
audit report.

4.0 Data Breach. 

Licensor further agrees that it will monitor and test its Data 
Safeguards from time to time, and further agrees to adjust its Data Safeguards 
from time to time in light of relevant circumstances or the results of any 
relevant testing or monitoring. If Licensor suspects or becomes aware of any 
unauthorized access to any Customer Data or Personal Data by any unauthorized person 
or third party, or becomes aware of any other security breach relating to Personal 
Data held or stored by Licensor under this Agreement or in connection with the 
performance of the Professional Services or other services performed under this 
Agreement or any Statement(s) of Work ("Data Breach"), Licensor shall immediately 
notify Customer in writing and shall fully cooperate with Customer at Licensor's 
expense to prevent or stop such Data Breach. In the event of such Data Breach, 
Licensor shall fully and immediately comply with applicable laws, and shall take 
the appropriate steps to remedy such Data Breach. Licensor will defend, indemnify 
and hold Customer, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, 
employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, causes 
of action, liability, loss, costs and damages, including reasonable attorney fees, 
arising out of or relating to any third party claim arising from breach by Licensor 
of its obligations contained in this Section, except to the extent resulting from 
the acts or omissions of Customer. All Personal Data to which Licensor has access 
under this Agreement, as between Licensor and Customer, will remain the property 
of Customer. Customer hereby consents to the use, processing and/or disclosure 
of Personal Data only for the purposes described herein and to the extent such 
use or processing is necessary for Licensor to carry out its duties and 
responsibilities under this Agreement, any applicable Statement(s) of Work, or 
as required by law. Licensor will not transfer Personal Data to third parties 
other than through its underlying network provider to perform its obligations 
under this Agreement. All Personal Data delivered to Licensor shall be stored 
in the United States or other jurisdictions approved by Customer in writing and 
shall not be transferred to any other countries or jurisdictions without the 
prior written consent of Customer.

**Date Security Exhibit**:
EXHIBIT __ Data Security

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Master Services and 
License Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached ("Agreement" ), and all other 
Exhibits thereto, and in addition to and not in lieu of other provisions in the 
Agreement and the Exhibits thereto, Licensor agrees as follows:

1.0 General Security Procedures

1.1 Without limiting Licensor's obligation of confidentiality as further described 
in the Agreement and herein, Licensor will be responsible for establishing and 
maintaining an information security program that is designed to: (i) ensure the 
security and confidentiality of Customer Data; (ii) protect against any anticipated
 threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Customer Data; (iii) 
 protect against unauthorized access to or use of the Customer Data; (iv) ensure 
 the proper disposal of Customer Data, as further defined herein; and (v) ensure 
 that all subcontractors of Licensor, if any, comply with all of the foregoing. 
 Licensor will designate an individual to be responsible for the information 
 security program. Such individual will respond to Customer inquiries regarding 
 computer security and to be responsible for notifying Customer‐designated 
 contact(s) if a breach or an incident occurs, as further described herein. The 
 information security program will be audited annually as detailed in Licensor's 
 SSAE 16 and/or SOC 1 audit reports, which will be made available to Customer upon request.

1.2 Licensor must conduct formal security awareness training, with a testing 
component, for all personnel and contractors as soon as reasonably practicable 
after the time of hiring or prior to being appointed to work on Customer Data 
and annually recertified thereafter. Documentation of Security Awareness 
Training must be retained by Licensor, confirming that this training and 
subsequent annual recertification process have been completed, and available for 
review by Customer.

1.3 Customer will have the right to review Licensor's information security program 
prior to the commencement of Customer's entry of data into the Products or delivery 
to Customer of any Professional Services and from time to time during the Term 
of this Agreement. During the Term of the Agreement, from time to time with 
proper notice and Licensor approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, 
Customer, at its own expense, will be entitled to perform, or to have performed, 
an on‐site audit of Licensor's information security program and facilities. In 
lieu of an on‐site audit, upon request by Customer, Licensor will use reasonable 
efforts to complete, within forty‐five (45 days) of receipt, an Information 
Security Assessment questionnaire provided by Customer regarding Licensor's 
information security program.

1.4 In the event of any actual or apparent theft, unauthorized use or disclosure 
of any Customer Data, Licensor will immediately commence all reasonable efforts 
to investigate and correct the causes and remediate the results thereof, and 
within two (2) business days following discovery of any such event, provide 
Customer notice thereof, and such further information and assistance as may be 
reasonably requested.

1.5 Customer Data, including but not limited to sales data, hosted, stored, or 
held by Licensor in the Product(s) or in the platform operated by Licensor, or 
on any device owned or in the custody of Licensor, its employees, agents or 
contractors, will be encrypted. Licensor will not transmit any unencrypted 
Customer Data over the internet or a wireless network, and will not store any 
Customer Data on any mobile computing device, such as a laptop computer, USB 
drive or portable data device, except where there is a business necessity and 
then only if the mobile computing device is protected by industry‐standard 
encryption software approved by Customer.

1.6 The parties acknowledge and agree that any disclosure of Customer Data will 
in no way be construed to be an assignment, transfer, or conveyance of title to 
or ownership rights in such Customer Data.

2.0 Network and Communications Security

2.1 All Licensor connectivity to Customer computing systems and all attempts at 
same will be only through Customer's security gateways/firewalls and only through 
Customer‐approved security procedures.

2.2 Licensor will not access, and will not permit unauthorized persons or entities 
to access, Customer computing systems and/or networks without Customer's express 
written authorization, and any such actual or attempted access will be consistent 
with any such authorization.

2.3 Licensor will take appropriate measures to ensure that Licensor's systems 
connecting to Customer's systems and anything provided to Customer through such 
systems do not contain any Disabling Device. For purposes of this Agreement, 
"Disabling Device" means any programs, mechanisms, programming devices, malware 
or other computer code (i) designed to disrupt, disable, harm, or otherwise 
impede in any manner the operation of any software program or code, or any 
computer system or network (commonly referred to as "malware", "spyware", "viruses"
 or "worms"); (ii) that would disable or impair the operation thereof or of any 
 software, computer system or network in any way based on the elapsing of a 
 period of time or the advancement to a particular date or other numeral (referred 
 to as "time bombs", "time locks", or "drop dead" devices); (iii) is designed to
  or could reasonably be used to permit a party or any third party to access any 
  computer system or network (referred to as "trojans", "traps", "access codes" 
  or "trap door" devices); or (iv) is designed to or could reasonably be used to
   permit a party or any third party to track, monitor or otherwise report the 
   operation and use of any software program or any computer system or network 
   by the other party or any of its customers.

3.0 Customer Data Handling Procedures
Erasure of Information and Destruction of Electronic Storage Media. If Customer
Data is required to be permanently deleted from any storage media owned or operated 
by Licensor, all electronic storage media containing Customer Data must be wiped 
or degaussed for physical destruction or disposal, in a manner meeting forensic 
industry standards such as the NIST SP800‐88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization. 
Licensor must maintain documented evidence of data erasure and destruction. This 
evidence must be available for review at the request of Customer.

4.0 Physical Security
All backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be contained in secure, 
environmentally‐controlled storage areas owned, operated, or contracted for by 
Licensor and all backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be 
encrypted.

5.0 Penetration Testing
Licensor will provide Customer with an annual, third party Penetration Test report. 
During the term of this Agreement, Licensor will engage, at its own expense and 
at least one time per year, a third party vendor reasonably acceptable to 
Customer to perform penetration and vulnerability testing ("Penetration Tests") 
with respect to Licensor's systems. The objective of such Penetration Tests is 
to identify design and/or functionality issues in infrastructure of Licensor's 
systems that could expose Customer Data and its computer and network equipment 
and systems to risks from malicious activities. Penetration Tests will probe for
 weaknesses in network perimeters or other infrastructure elements as well as 
 weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures relating to Licensor's systems
  that could be exploited by a malicious party. Penetration Tests will identify, 
  at a minimum, the following security vulnerabilities: invalidated or unsanitized 
  input; broken access control; broken authentication and session management; 
  cross‐site scripting (XSS) flaws; buffer overflows; injection flaws; improper 
  error handling; insecure storage; denial of service; insecure configuration 
  management; proper use of SSL/TLS; proper use of encryption; and anti‐virus 
  reliability and testing. Within a reasonable period after the annual Penetration 
  Test has been performed, Customer may request from Licensor a report of any 
  high level and medium level security issues that were revealed during such 
  Penetration Test and subsequent certification in writing to Customer that such 
  high level and medium level security issues have been fully remediated. To the
   extent that high level and/or medium level security issues were revealed during 
   a particular Penetration Test, Licensor will subsequently engage, at its own 
   expense, the Testing Customer to perform an additional Penetration Test within
    a reasonable period thereafter to ensure continued resolution of identified 
    security issues and will notify Customer with the results thereof.

 6.0 Background Checks
Licensor will perform background checks on all Licensor personnel and direct hire 
contractors including temporary and non‐employee personnel who will be performing 
services for Customer, including but not limited to implementation services under 
any Statement(s) of Work, that requires access to Customer Data pursuant to this 
Agreement. Licensor will not assign any employee to perform services for Customer 
who has not authorized a background investigation, or whose background 
investigation has revealed the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor within the 
previous seven (7) years, measured back from the time such Licensor employee 
commences services pursuant to the Agreement, to the extent such felony or 
misdemeanor relates to the suitability of the individual's employment, except to
 the extent prohibited by applicable law. If Licensor contracts, for any services, 
 with a third party that needs to be allowed or requires access to Customer Data, 
 the third party will undergo the same Licensor background checks as performed on 
 Licensor personnel and contractors under this section.

7.0 SSAE‐16/SOC‐1
Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (together with any 
related agreements, including licenses and/or Statement(s) of Work) and receive 
a full refund for all monies prepaid thereunder in the event that Licensor fails 
to produce an acceptable SSAE‐16/ SOC‐1 Type II report.
[End of Exhibit Language] 

__________________________________________

**Information Security Breach Notification Clause**.

[Cloud Provider] agrees to notify Customer within two (2) business days in writing 
of any discovery by [Cloud Provider] of any breach or suspected breach of the 
provisions of this Agreement or any loss or unauthorized use, disclosure, acquisition 
of or access to any Customer Confidential Information and/or Customer's business 
systems of which [Cloud Provider] becomes aware (any such breach or suspected 
breach being referred to herein as a "Data Breach" ). Such notice shall summarize 
in reasonable detail the effect on Customer, if known, of the Data Breach and the
