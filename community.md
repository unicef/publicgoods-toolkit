# Community And Ecosystem


**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: Communities and ecosystems around open source projects are not all the same. Their differences matter in setting correct expectations around likely project dynamics, health, and sustainability. With an ecosystem map as background, consider what project archetype might roughly fit the open source project you're evaluating or that you plan to launch. Although these maps are inexact approximations that change over time, this is a key level-setting exercise for your team when assessing an open source project or planning to create your own, and it should be periodically revisited.

**KEY RECOMMENDATION** Diversity among participants making the most resource investments in an open source project indicates stability, resilience and growth potential for most project archetypes. Look for diversity in areas like employers of contributors or of vendors providing support services, such as customization, deployment assistance, maintenance and operations, and training. 

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: To roughly assess the health of an open source project, look at the bug tracker to understand the activity 'vibrancy' around the project. The bug tracker, along with other web resources like user forums, should also give you some insight into the diversity of developers and commercial participants. Diversity, the growth rate of adoption, and a well structured ability to respond to input are good markers of health and sustainability. The level of quality community 'scaffolding' around a project, such as documentation, should also fit what you'd expect for that project's type. And lastly, talking to a sample of diverse participants will also give you as sense for how the community is doing. 

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: Encouraging commercial participation can be useful to a DPG's adoption and sustainability, but take care to foster diverse commercial actors and be wary of creating commerical opportunities that could permit unfair advantage.

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: A 'hard fork' of a project to meet your needs should always be a last resort. Such an action might be appropriate for a mature open source product in which there is community understanding of and support for your new direction, but this is a costly and fraught thing to do and would require thorough planning and much foresight.  

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: For you own DPG, consider how you might approach financial sustainability differently across the project's stages. Monolithic funding isn't necessarily the answer. The types and sources of available funding options might change as a project progresses.

Understanding how to work with, participate in, and foster a successful open source project is not just a matter of understanding the software at a technical level; it also requires understanding the motivations and interrelationships of the people and organizations who do make up the project. While we touch upon some aspects of finding or nurturing a broader DPG supportive ecosystem at the national level in the Introduction [LINK], this module provides guidance on understanding project-level communities and ecosystems. The Adoptability module [LINK] provides even more detailed recommendations for putting this understanding into evaluating open source projects, including how to map a project's ecosystem.  

DPG efforts run on the collective motivations of all of their
participants.  A healthy project often gathers around itself a diverse
ecosystem in which many participants cooperate, each for their own
reasons.  Those reasons need not be the same.  They might even be in
tension or in outright competition with each other.  Open source
processes excel at enabling many parties with divergent interests to
cooperate and create shared value.

We can refer to the direct participants in an open project as the
project's community.  In addition to that close community of
cooperating participants, we find that successful projects gather a
larger ecosystem around them.  This ecosystem is centered on the
community, and also includes related open source efforts, users,
integrators, clients, competitors, and stakeholders.  Anybody who has
an interest in the project's output and operations is part of the
ecosystem.

Communities can contain governmental, commercial, or volunteer
contributors, though the lines between these categories often blur.
"Volunteer" contributors who aren't being paid directly for their work
in a project often have a business interest in the output of the
project.  Similarly, commercial vendors might be participating as part
of a government contract.  Roles are fluid, and strictly labelling
community participants can at times be reductionist.

What everybody in the community has in common is that they gain an
advantage to pooling their resources: there's no reason for any one
agency or firm to shoulder the entire burden of fixing bugs or
developing new features when they all need the same bugs fixed and,
for the most part, the same features developed.  This common interest,
built around a zone of cooperation, is the core of a project's
community.

Wider ecosystems can also contain a diversity of participants from
many different sectors.  Even though most participants in the extended
ecosystem of stakeholders do not directly contribute to a project,
they help the project realize its value in the world. These stakeholders can include investors, NGOs, funders, end users, and even competing and adjacent efforts. They magnify
the value of the investments made by direct participants.  And of
course, the best place to recruit new community contributors is from
that wider ecosystem.

The import of all this value, investment, and mutual reliance is that
successful DPG communities are usually built on mutual or collective benefit.
Although it is certainly accurate to refer to this collective as a
"community" -- it has social relations, cultural norms, status
differentiation, informal debt relations, and all the other aspects of
human communities -- it is not a community that runs on altruism.
Even mission-driven participation is best understood as value-seeking
(but not value-capturing) in open communities.  


## Project Archetypes

One of the most important skills for agencies exploring open source is
understanding existing ecosystems and their project's place within
them.  In order to plan a project that builds on or collaborates with
other open source efforts, agencies must know their own projects and
also know what to expect from other community participants. Again, the Adoptability module [LINK] describes how to map a project's ecosystem. 

Open source projects operate in many different ways.  Experienced open
source practitioners build nuanced open source strategies by
pattern-matching against other open source projects.  They use those
patterns to understand their own projects and also the other open
source efforts around them. This understanding guides how they approach adopting an open source product, who they will recruit as new contributors to an existing project -- basically, this understanding guides their expectations, decisions and investments. Practitioners with a lot of experience
have seen many different types of projects succeed and fail in all
kinds of situations.  Less experienced practitioners pattern match
against a smaller set, which is to say they might have only one or a
small handful of open source approaches and find it difficult to
perform nuanced analysis.

Mozilla identified this experience gap as a general problem in open
source, and developed a set of open source project archetypes to give
practitioners more patterns to match against.  A note of caution: a given project won't
necessarily fit perfectly into one of these archetypes, and a project
might not reflect the same archetype(s) for its entire history --
transitions happen all the time.  In some projects, one sees multiple
archetypes at work or even different sets of participants pushing the
project toward separate archetypal practices.

Still, the purpose of the archetypes is to lead people away from generic open
source thinking and toward considering in more detail the behaviors
and dynamics their open source investment seeks to create.  Each
archetype tends toward typical strategies, and categorizing projects
by archetype can help in predicting behavior.  Similarly, where the
strategies deviate, we can usually find deviation from the archetype
too.  The more specific you are about what you want from open source
in your particular context, the more you will be able to look for
patterns and practices in successful open source projects that operate
in similar contexts.  
 
For example, in evaluating an existing open source project, you wouldn’t expect a ‘rocket ship’ project to invest in supporting new contributors, while you’d want to select a code repository tool that’s most familiar to all participants if creating and fostering your own multi-vendor infrastructure project.  

A complete discussion of each archetype is available in Mozilla's
report.  Below are just their names and brief descriptions, from which
one might draw some ideas of pattern each one represents.  (The [full
report is here](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes), and there
is also a [quick-reference
chart](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2-quick-ref.pdf)
available.)

* [Wide Open](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.13)

  The project intends large-scale collaboration and is willing to slow
  down certain aspects of development in order to scale up the number
  of contributors, increase the diversity of contribution sources, and
  take more points of view into account. An example would be the [Apache HTTP Server project](https://httpd.apache.org/). 

* [Rocket Ship to Mars](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.10)

  The project is driven by a small, tightly-focused core team that
  knows exactly where it's going.  If you want to go there too, you
  can get on board the rocket ship, but right now the project is not
  looking for (and will not stop for) discussions about alternative
  roadmaps, unplanned features, or unsolicited goals.  This archetype
  is often found in funded projects that are in their early stages. An example might be the [Signal messaging application](https://signal.org/en/), along with the DPG [AIAgro](https://rentadrone.cl/developers/ai-agro/). 

* [B2B Open Source](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.8)

  The project is sponsored and largely driven by a commercial
  organization, and is aimed at users who are also commercial
  organizations.  The sponsoring organization may have a direct revnue
  interest in a product based on the project, or may have a strategic
  interest (for example, undermining a competitor's product). Google's [Android operating system](https://source.android.com/) is a great example here. 

* [Specialty Library](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.15)

  The project's goal is to provide a high-quality solution to a narrow
  and specific problem.  Meaningful participation requires familiarity and expertise
  with that problem and with the project's solution. The [libmp4](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libmp4/) software library to handle MP4 files is an example. 

* [Multi-Vendor Infrastructure](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.9)

  When a number of commercial organizations share a common need, it
  makes sense for them to pool their resources into one open source
  project that meets that need, rather than each one developing their
  own separate but duplicative solution. For example:[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. [X-Road's distributed data exchange](https://x-road.global/x-road-technology-overview) is a DPG example here. 

  (See [Spot The Pattern:
  Commoditization](https://blog.opentechstrategies.com/2019/10/commoditization/).)

* [Mass Market](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.14)

  An open source project aimed at very broad user adoption.  Mass Market projects often have
  commercial sponsorship of some kind, and if they are successful they
  tend to have fairly elaborate mechanisms to help steer potential
  contributors to the right place -- because even a tiny fraction of
  the user base trying to file bug reports or send in improvements can
  be overwhelming if you have millions of users. The [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) open source office suite is an example here, as is [Mozilla's Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). 

* [Upstream Dependency](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.17)

  A project that serves as a dependency to a wide variety of other
  projects.  Many of the common web-development Javascript libraries
  fit well into this archetype, for example.  Their governance tends
  to be somewhat informal, perhaps because the variety of projects
  that depend on them serves as its own kind of constraint on
  decision-making, thus reducing the need for highly structured
  governance.

* [Trusted Vendor](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.16)

  A commercial organization with unique expertise may sometimes
  maintain an open source project that simultaneously serves to
  advertise that expertise, to maintain it, and to provide leads on
  direct or indirect sources of revenue.  Interaction with these
  projects is sometimes equivalent to interaction with that particular
  vendor. The [Coral web site commenting and community building platform](https://coralproject.net/) is such an example, with Vox Media supporting the open source project and making money through hosting, training and implementation help. 

* [Controlled Ecosystem](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.12)

  This is most often seen with highly extensible software: a dominant
  company maintains the core project (and a corresponding product from
  which they non-exclusively derive revenue), surrounded by a
  satellite community of extension providers.  Interaction with the
  core project can be very different from interaction with that
  extension ecosystem.  Although the core development is usually
  dominated by the founding company, the extensions market place has
  often served as an incubator for other vendors who provide support,
  so the presence of the dominant player does not usually imply a
  monopoly on support availability. The open source [WordPress web site builder](https://wordpress.com/) is an example, where WordPress invests the most in developing the core platform but supports a range of indepdendent extension developers and professional services. You could categorize Estonia's DPG X-road (now managed by the Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)) here too, as it [supports extension development]() 
  https://x-road.global/xroad-technology-partners-companies). The DPG [Primero](https://www.primero.org/) could also fit here. 

  Assessing software extensibility is also covered in the Adoptability module [LINK].

* [Single Maintainer Houseplant](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.11)

  A single person started the project, has maintained it all along,
  and either has not wanted to or has not been able to expand its
  developer base. (While this kind of open source project definitely
  exists, it is perhaps overrepresented in writings and public
  discussion about open source.)

* [Bathwater](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf#section*.18)

  A project whose source code has been published under an open source
  license, but which is now being ignored by its original authors.
  The code was thrown over the wall, as the saying goes, and it is
  there for anyone else to pick up if they want.



### Identifying Archetypes In Your Community

The most common archetype we observe in the wild is the "Wide Open"
project.  This is normally what people think of when they imagine an
open source project.  Wide Open projects take all comers and try to
gather as much dev momentum as they can.  They skew toward shared
governance models and cultivate a welcoming, inclusive air.  This
approach is popular for a reason--- it's a pretty good default
starting point for a lot of projects, especially government-led open
source.

But not all projects fit that mold.  Sometimes you want to build an
open source ecosystem and absolutely must retain a strong, controlling
position to achieve the policy goals that drive your open source work.
In industry, we see that, for example, with Google's Android work.
There, one company makes the majority of the investment, and benefits
by steering the majority of the mobile market to its products,
services, and advertising network.

In Android's case, the additive value of individual additional
contributors to the ecosystem is fairly low.  It's not worth giving up
control to gain those contributions.  A Wide Open approach doesn't fit
Google's strategic need.  Instead, one can classify that project as
B2B Open Source, which is a much less inviting model.

In government, we see this type of cautious approach around crucial
infrastructure.  Election infrastructure projects, for example, has a
very high bar for participation and is only useful to government
agencies and the vendors who serve them.  Such projects might try to
be Wide Open, but will in practice tend toward a blend of the
characteristics of multivendor infrastructure and specialty library.

Archetypes help us identify that Android is not like a stereotypical
open source project.  They help us predict the dynamics around open
source election infrastructure. They allow us to see a project's
actual behavior rather than the expected or stereotypical behavior.
We can use archetypes to reveal something about a project's strategy
and helps us form credible expectations about how the project will
behave in the future.  It would be disastrous, for example, to build a
product strategy that depends on being able to have any influence on
Android's road map or feature set.  Anybody who misidentifies Google's
strategy on that point (and there have been a few) is defeated before
they write a single line of code.

Although government agencies can expect to find the full range of
archetypes among the projects it encounters, its own projects will
tend to fall into just a few categories.  Many government projects
lean toward "Wide Open" dynamics, and that archetype is a good default
starting point for consideration.  Less often one finds "Controlled
Ecosystem," "Multi-Vendor Infrastructure," and "Trusted Vendor"
archetypes.  All of these are candidates for projects lead by or
originating in government agencies, depending on strategic and policy
needs.

There are other cases where archetypes help us understand the open
source world around us.  In each case, the archetypes are a rough lens
that leads us to clarify our view of a product's position.  The
archetypes, though, are just a starting point.  They are a shared
vocabulary for a conversation that should eventually move beyond
archetypal thinking.  After all, a project's success will come in
details much finer than a few archetypes could possibly capture.

It is always important to remember that ultimately each archetype is a
simplification.  Every successful project grows because it is
well-fitted to the particular needs of its contributors and users.  If
you view the archetypes as a set of slightly-more-specific generic
game plans, you lose most of their value.  They are a starting point
for consideration.  As a project grows and adapts to its niche, its
strategy and planning can and should move to a uniquely detailed view
of its needs.  Archetypes are a useful start to analysis, but the
conversation should never end there.

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: Communities and ecosystems around open source projects are not all the same. Their differences matter in setting correct expectations around likely project dynamics, health, and sustainability. With an ecosystem map as background, consider what project archetype might roughly fit the open source project you're evaluating or that you plan to launch. Although these maps are inexact approximations that change over time, this is a key level-setting exercise for your team when assessing an open source project or planning to create your own, and it should be periodically revisited.


[Susy leaving this here for OTS/UNICEF] --> (TBD: There is more to say here of course, but this section is getting
long, so let's leave off for the moment and not go deeper than we
need.  Note: Victor
[suggests](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/pull/12#discussion_r651325121)
including a mapping/analysis of some existing DPGs to the archetypes.
We can add that analysis after doing some interviews. From Susy -- we're not getting good insights from the interviews. I suggest we look at categorize two different DPGs as examples but otherwise link to some of the not-necessarily-fully-qualified-DPGs for the archetypes, as done in the original paper)

## Community Diversity

[TODO: UNICEF wants "Justin" to review this section on health and diversity?]

There are many ways to think about the diversity of an open source
project community.  Do its contributors come from a wide variety of
geographic or cultural origins?  Do they represent a wide variety of
skill levels?  Do they represent a wide variety of usage patterns?  Do
they represent a variety of organizations and organizational needs?
Does the project have diverse paths by which someone can contribute
(e.g., coding, testing, documentation, bug ticket management, etc)?

Any of these dimensions of diversity may be relevant for adoption of a
DPG, and its useful to think about what dimensions matter as you create your ecosystem map.  However, we especially urge consideration of diversity of
investment -- i.e., employer diversity among the various contributors,
and diversity among vendors offering support services -- simply
because these aspects of diversity are so often overlooked, and yet
are so important to the health and success of a DPG. This diversity is particularly important to projects that aren't speciality software libraries, although even there overreliance on one contributor type can be problematic.

In considering diversity, including diversity of investment sources,
it is useful to recall that participants tend to exercise control over
a project in rough proportion to investment and to a lesser degree to
reliance and benefit.  Diversifying contributions will usually
diversify the voices that dictate a project's direction.

Conversely, projects that over-rely on one provider of resources often
find themselves at risk of over-fitting their products to the needs of
that resource-dominant participant.  This tends to depress
contribution, which further concentrates investment.  As projects
retreat from open collaboration, they become more vulnerable to their
one, dominant participant leaving the project or shifting direction.

This tendency for non-diversified projects to further centralize is
often a risk for early-stage DPG projects. At the start of most
projects, communities are not usually diverse.  They haven't attracted
enough participants to have diversity.  Projects in this situation
often find they have to invest in outreach and make special efforts to
attract new participants.

**KEY RECOMMENDATION** Diversity among those making the most resource investments in an open source project indicates stability, resilience and growth potential for most project archetypes. Look for diversity in areas like employers of contributors or of vendors providing support services, such as customization, deployment assistance, maintenance and operations, and training. 
 

## Community Health

The technology industry has been wrangling with how best to measure and understand open source community health metrics for some time. There are frameworks that consider health from a business ecosytem perspective, like the [Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization (OSEHO) framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261715766_Measuring_the_Health_of_Open_Source_Software_Ecosystems_Beyond_the_Scope_of_Project_Health), and standardized activity measurements created by the Linux Foundation's [Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS)](https://chaoss.community/) working group. Such activity metrics are useful but can be insufficient to determining health without a deeper knowledge of the project's goals and type. For example, pull request efficiency might not be as important to a multi-vendor infrastructure type project as the rate at which partner contributors pick up high priority issues.

In the big picture, an open source community's health and sustainability ultimately depends on the presence
of a user base that needs the DPG and is willing, directly or
indirectly, to invest in it.  New contributors come from either those
users or from the organizations that service those users; useful
feature direction for the project's roadmap comes likewise from those
users or their representatives; and bug reports -- the lifeblood of an
active open source project -- come ultimately from those users.

Some of these details can be gleaned from an open source project's code repository. Unfortunately, the tools for analyzing metrics are complicated for decision makers without some technical know-how. The CHAOSS working group does provide open source software for running analytics on GitHub and GitLab, which are among most popular repository management services, as well as on issue tracking systems, but again, these take some know-how to use. 

[SUSY NOTE: It looks like CHAOSS will also run analytics for requesters, but I don't think this is a very program and don't think we should recommend, but I wanted to point this out. UNICEF might want to mention plans for their own service]

Still, even a novice can gain some useful insights by looking at activity over time in the bug tracker and the record of change, and this is often a fine enough way to roughly assess the health of a project community (and a note here that 'bugs' as referenced here are also known as 'issues'). 

* What is the rate of ticket filings and the approximate number of
  unique filers?  These two factors together are a proxy for the size
  and level of the user base.

* How often do project developers respond in bug tickets?  How well do
  they respond: are they constructive, both with users and with other
  developers in the discussion?  Do the responses result in changes to
  the product itself?

* Is it always the same developer, or small set of developers
  responding?  Or is responsiveness well-distributed throughout the
  development team? Is there the diversity of developers and commercial participants you'd expect for the project type?

The rate at which bug reports are closed is actually not very
important.  In a healthy project with an active user base, bug reports
are sometimes filed faster than the development team can close them.
The important question is not rate of resolution, but how the project
responds to and organizes the influx of reports. 

A healthy project also has development spread across multiple
developers.  Exactly how many depends on the size of the project; it's
not uncommon for a project to have a few very active developers doing
most of the work, and then a "long tail" of other developers doing the
rest.  But the gentleness of that curve, from the most active
developers to the least, tends to correlate with project health.

Moving up to a higher level of consideration, a project community
tends to be healthier and more sustainable the greater the number and variety of its
commercial participants. Depending on the project archetype, a lack of commercial participants isn't necessarily a sign of a languishing community, but the presence of engaged commercial participants does confirm that a project is creating value. There's the added concern of project overreliance on individual unpaid volunteers, who suffer high burnout rates. Of course, commercial participation can bring its own issues as noted below, including the potential to being prone to changing priorities more quickly than non-commercial participants.  In fact, at least one open source
stewardship organization has a rule that it will only accept projects
as members if there is a sufficient diversity of employers across the
project's individual maintainers.  Their logic is that if most of the
developers in the project are employed by a single company and that
company changes priorities, the project will be in immediate
danger of folding.

Again, it is difficult to offer absolute numbers or base metrics that
indicate whether a project is "healthy" or not.  All the data gleaned
from a project's bug tracker must be considered in the wider context
of the rest of the project.  Project metrics, especially as they
change over time, are strong signals that add to the understanding of
a project.  They are not, however, very informative on their own.

There are two other relatively obvious tasks that should complement the quick glance at a project's bug tracker that we describe above. First, a little web surfing can take you to valuable project discussion forums, news release (see also the Adoptability module) [LINK] and other public information and can also help you evaluate if the project has the level of community 'scaffolding' (documentation, clear governance processes, security vulnerability reporting) that you'd expect for such a project type and its maturity. Second, actually speaking to a variety of people involved in the project almost always leads to valuable insights. 

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: To roughly assess the health of an open source project, look at the bug tracker to understand the activity 'vibrancy' around the project. The bug tracker, along with other web resources like user forums, should also give you some insight into the diversity of developers and commercial participants. Diversity, the growth rate of adoption, and a well structured ability to respond to input are good markers of health and sustainability. The level of quality community 'scaffolding' around a project, such as documentation, should also fit what you'd expect for that project's type. And lastly, talking to a sample of diverse participants will also give you as sense for how the community is doing. 

Community health, as outlined above, matters to DPGs because community
health is the key to sustainability.  Those who are investing in those
DPGs should consider every action they take from a community health
perspective.  For example, when choosing between vendors, if one of
those vendors is already highly dominant in the project community, it
could be advantageous (from the project's perspective) for you to
choose a different vendor -- assuming that vendor can competently
provide the needed services -- in order to help equalize
the balance of power between commercial actors in the project. Of course, procurement rules might require choosing the lowest bidder or include other decisive factors that run counter to community health considerations, but we're describing an ideal state here. 

Note that many aspects of open source project community health are
also discussed, implicitly and sometimes explicitly, in the
Adoptability module [LINK].


## Non-Commercial Participants

Depending on the open source project, there may be fewer or more
non-commercial participants than commercial ones; it varies from
project to project.

A "non-commercial" participant, in this context, can mean one of two
things:

1) An organizational participant that is ultimately motivated by
   something other than profit.

2) An individual developer who contributes to the project but is not
   directly paid for that work.

Organizational non-commercial participants are usually NGOs
(non-profit organizations) or government agencies.  They are often
motivated by equity concerns -- making sure the product is available
and usable in contexts where it might not otherwise be -- or a desire
to avoid having public data or public goods monopolized in a
proprietary system (with the attendant risks of vendor lock-in, as described in Adoptability: Data Portability and Avoiding Vendor Lock-In)[LINK]

Such participants often act in the project through vendors, and the
vendors of course have a commercial interest as well.  In these cases,
there can occasionally be conflicts between the two parties'
motivations.  For example, the NGO client may want an API capability
that the vendor is reluctant to add because the presence of that
capability in the open source product would reduce the value of some
proprietary offering of the vendor's.

There is no general formula for avoiding nor for resolving such
conflicts.  However, those selecting and deploying DPGs should be
aware of the potential for those kinds of conflicts to arise.  Mere
awareness of the possibility may be enough to aid negotations and
motivate early contract clarity.

Individual contributors who are not directly paid for their work are
more often called "volunteers", but it is also reasonable to call them
non-commercial participants.  A volunteer's motivations may be
connected to their current job or business interests, but if they are
ultimately participating as an individual contributor and their
participation is likely to persist across changes of employment, then
they have a bond with the project that goes beyond their day job and
their motivation can be said to be non-commercial.  Every individual
in the project usually has at least some non-commercial element to
their participation.  Even developers who work on the project
full-time as their salaried job generally retain their community
status in the project if they move from employer to employer.

It is worth noting that some DPG communities might confine themselves
to non-commercial participants.  Most DPG licenses allow commercial as
a well as non-commercial use, but not all.  While it is rarely useful
for governments to create communities with such restrictions, agencies
might encounter non-commercial communities in the course of their
work.

The most frequent form of non-commercial DPG are creative works
publised under a Creative Commons license "NC" license.  The "NC"
stands for "non-commercial".  Not all Creative Commons work is
restricted to non-commercial use, so agencies should be sure to look
at *which* Creative Commons license applies to materials they use.

In the case of open source software all commonly used licenses allow
commerical use, as noted in the Introduction [LINK].  In fact, most community participants would classify
software whose license disallows commercial use as "not open source".
The Open Source Initiative offers what many community participants
agree is an authoritative definition of "open source".  That
definition excludes software that discriminates against commercial
use.  All commonly-used open source licenses and most projects align
on this point.

At the same time, some open source community members are offering
"Ethical Source" licenses.  These licenses restrict the use of DPGs
when their use might contravene various social values.  Regardless of
whether or not we call these licenses "open source", people working on
DPGs in a government context might well come across DPGs that use
these licenses.

In considering commercial vs non-commercial communities, agencies
should keep in mind that most jurisdictions have defined "commercial"
in a clear way as it applies to open licensing.  While governmental
use would seem to be quite clearly non-commercial, in some
jurisdictions, it might be less clear when vendors work on DPGs on
behalf of government clients. This is something to clarify early in evaluating an open source project. 


## Commercial Participants

All open source software licenses, by the most common definition,
allow commercial as well as non-commercial use of the software, and it
is typical for open source projects to have both commercial and
non-commercial participants.  Some individuals may even represent both
types at different times.

Successful commercial participants tend to take a fairly long-term
view of their participation.  They are in the project because it
enables them to provide some product or service, and that means that
their future (for that product or service) is tied to the project --
which means that future is tied to the community, which means that
their credibility with and relationships to others in the community
have an economic value that goes beyond one day's bugfix or another
day's feature request.

This economic value is understood as such quite literally by those
participants.  For example, when a company that is very active in an
important open source project is the willing target of an acquisition,
it works with the acquirer to place a monetary value -- a definite
number -- on its relationship to and influence in that project.  That
number is partly computed by looking at the individual employees at
the target company who are active in the project, determining numbers
for *their* participation in the project, and estimating their chances
of staying on board after the acquisition.

Interestingly, this does not mean that those employees, who are
members of the project community, are viewed with suspicion by other
members.  Everyone understands that each person is there for a reason,
and commercial reasons are not thought of as better or worse than any
other reason.  As long as people act with care for the project's
long-term interest, and their quality of work is high, their
motivations might be useful context but are largely their own
business. 

Some DPG projects go even a step further.  As a way to spur further
investment by commercial participants, they undertake to create
commercial opportunities for participants.  Sometimes these
opportunities tend to reward more active project participants.  So
long as these opportunities do not start to create monopolizable
advantages, they can be effective ways to promote sustainability for
some DPG efforts. A review of an open source project's governance documents, if available, can give you some additional sense of how well commercial engagement is steered towards the collective good. 

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: Encouraging commercial participation can be useful to a DPG's adoption and sustainability, but take care to foster diverse commercial actors and be wary of creating commerical opportunities that could permit unfair advantage.  

## Community Lifecycle, Longevity, and Sustainability

All DPGs have a lifecycle.  That lifecycle may not be knowable in
advance, but it will eventually become apparent.  As a project
matures, its rate of user acquisition slows down, the rate at which
new contributors come in likewise slows down, and, in the long run,
the rate of new feature development slows as well.

Projects that have an extensible design (see Extensibility section in the
[Adoptability](/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability) module) often have a longer lifecycle, though
this may be correlation rather than causation: longer-lived projects
tend to become extensible, and innovation can continue to happen in
the plugin ecosystem even after the software's core has remained
stable for a long time.  But, perhaps with rare exceptions, most
software projects that last long enough eventually reach a stable
state: either they address their problem domain so well that no
further improvement is needed, or they are overtaken by some newer,
nimbler competitor that was able to learn from its predecessors'
mistakes and that does not suffer from the burdens of having an old
code base that has accumulated [technical
debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

An organization adopting a DPG should try to ascertain, to the extent
possible, where in its lifecycle that DPG is.  It is not necessarily a
problem to adopt a DPG that is in the later, more static part of its
lifecycle.  Maturity has advantages: all the easily encountered bugs
have already been fixed, and the tool's features reflect, at least to
some degree, the accumulated wisdom of many users' real world usage.
But one should not expect the project's community to be eager to add
new features or have design discussions about complicated changes.  At
this point, the project may value stability relatively highly.  If the
DPG needs further work to be useful for a certain purpose, then that
work may have to happen outside the current project community. 

In this instance, some community members might decide to make what's known as a 'hard fork' (or 'social fork') of the project. This entails copying the source code and creating a separate open source project that's able to develop in a new direction -- an action that's entirely impossible under a non-open source code license. A well known example of a hard fork would be the creation of LibreOffice from the OpenOffice code base, which was a mass market type project sponsored by Sun Microsystems. When Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010, it was clear to OpenOffice participants that OpenOffice's competitive alternative to Microsoft Office wasn't important to Oracle's business strategy and continued investment, so they created a successful hard fork of OpenOffice and launched a new open source product and community called [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). 

However, hard forks aren't always successful. They're costly in terms of user confusion, potential legal wrangling over trademarks, and in-house and community resources, and they almost always harm community goodwill too.  Forking a project to meet your needs should always be a [last resort](https://producingoss.com/en/forks.html). However, agencies should be aware that this is an option for open source projects that are at a stage of maturity in which the community has made it clear that stability is more important than new features. In these instances, if there is no other alternative project that suits an agency's needs, it might be reasonable to consider a hard fork, and you might find the project's community supportive of your new direction.  

**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: A 'hard fork' of a project to meet your needs should always be a last resort. Such an action might be appropriate for a mature open source product in which there is community understanding of and support for your new direction, but this is a costly and fraught thing to do and would require thorough planning and much foresight.  

--> I left this here as FYI for OTS/UNICEF, there was an earlier discussion point re: including point about forks (TBD: Victor [agrees](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/pull/12#discussion_r651332349) Believe this is taken care of)

It's notable that content DPGs and software DPGs have different lifecycle
dynamics.  Software lends itself toward endless improvement.  There's
always a feature to add, a new library to adopt, or a new platform to
move to.  Some content sees high rates of reuse and longterm
evolution, but a lot of content settles in to a final version and
thereafter sees somewhat limited reuse.  A Creative Commons-licensed
novel, for example, might initially see revisions, a new edition, minor
fixes to typos, but eventually the book is done.  Somebody might make
a translation or undertake a second edition, but the original work is
readily identifiable as a "finished" artifact.

For software DPGs, it is also not necessarily a mistake to adopt a DPG
that is still in its early stages, when it is not completely stable
and some of its basic feature set may even be in flux.  But in that
case, one must be ready to make the investment -- either directly from
one's organization or through a consultant or vendor -- necessary to
have one's needs met within a certain period of time.  This can be a
"virtuous circle" in some cases: other entities, on seeing a clear
signal of investment, become more willing themselves to invest.

More specific recommendations around lifecycle and maturity in assessing a project's adoptability are covered in the Adoptability module. [LINK]
 
A final note on sustainability. As noted, health -- and thus sustainability -- really depends on whether a project is genuinely meeting the needs of its stakeholders, if it’s thoughtfully set up to be responsive to changing needs, and if a well diversified set of stakeholders is engaged and contributing. In many project types, stakeholders should probably include a varied set of commercial actors.
 
There’s also a related question of how DPGs can attract ongoing financial investments and what novel options are out there. 
 
Again, creating opportunities for private companies to commercially benefit is one option. The GFDDR used the power of modular contracting (see Procurement [LINK]) to bring in multiple vendors to develop GeoNode. As adoption of GeoNode grew, many of these companies found new clients for their GeoNode expertise, which gave them additional incentive to continue contributing to GeoNode and invest in its success (and this infusion of input from an expanded user base made the product better). George Gelaga-King, a Software Engineer from Sierra Leone’s Directorate of Science and Technology & Innovation, confirmed the value of thinking about how to attract private actors by creating economic opportunities. Depending on local circumstances and regulation, agencies themselves might even be able to offer commercial services around a DPG.  
 
[TODO: Can we draft a quote by George and run it by him? The interview notes didn’t provide anything exact. If there’s a recording we can pull it from there, or we can suggest something based on notes and make sure he’s ok with it? or we can just pull this]
 
However, fostering commercial engagement doesn’t exclude other options. GeoNode also worked with universities and other NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. It’s notable how the engagement of just one PhD student helped distribute GeoNode knowledge and expertise as he moved jobs between different agencies and organizations. 
 
Kari Moe Jacobsen, a senior advisor at the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), believes long-term collaborations between government ministries and academic institutions are a possible answer to broad DPG sustainability. She envisions DPGs being developed and maintained by universities -- sources of local talent that can also spin out new businesses --  with their implementation driven by government agencies, which have a ‘ground game’ understanding of their populations and experience working with NGO partners to expand their reach. This is the [model](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/the-transformative-role-of-academia-digital-public-goods/) followed by [District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2)](https://dhis2.org/), a DPG that aggregates and layers sector-specific health data. Here, research grants were thoughtfully linked to building the DPG. This model seems particularly promising when considering the problem of DPG discoverability and re-use by others -- instead of more ‘wheel inventing’ -- as academic institutions and governments already have collaborative networks and relationships that can be leveraged together. Philanthropic grant programs fit well here too. 
 
Collaborative financing is also an option, as NORAD helped bring to the [Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)](https://www.mosip.io/index.php). A university team did directly support MOSIP, but the collaboration was limited, so outside funding from the [World Bank’s Identification for Development (ID4D)](https://id4d.worldbank.org) rounded out the financial needs. Collaborative financing can be managed through intergovernmental organizations, like the World Bank, or through an NGO, like the [PATH](https://www.path.org/). PATH created the [Digital Square](https://digitalsquare.org) effort to coordinate investments from over 40 wide-ranging donor types -- including government agencies, intergovernmental organizations, universities, private foundations, and private companies -- to improve how the global community designs, uses, and pays for digital health tools and approaches. 
 
George Gelaga-King spoke of how pooling financial and personnel resources across agencies to create a DPG is also an option, although it can take a lot of upfront investment to identify internal partners who share your problem and are willing to collaborate to solve it. Each agency might hold tight to a set of features it believes are paramount and not see the value of collaborating to get to an 80% solution that they can then refine. However, solving shared problems while permitting flexibility for differentiation is core to the open source approach, as well as to modular architectures and extensibility (see Procurement and Adoptability [LINK]). Still, the complexity posed by internal agency collaboration is precisely why centralized digital services agencies are often at the forefront of government digital transformation. 
 
[Social impact bonds](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/SIBs-State-Play-Lessons-Final.pdf)(also known as development impact bonds) are another method of bringing private capital to the creation and maintenance of public goods. They’ve received a lot of attention and some uptake, but to our knowledge, this model hasn’t been used by a DPG. 
 
Social impact investment funds take varied shapes and can function like venture capital (like the [UNICEF Venture Fund](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/venturefund)), private equity, or a community development financial institution. These can be a great resource for helping to develop local commercial suppliers and talent. 
 
A tax or a precentage of revenue from the sale of public assets, such as from bandwidth allocation, could fund DPGs. So could a tax on private development projects, like the [‘percent for art’ programs](https://en.unesco.org/creativity/policy-monitoring-platform/percent-art-scheme) that require private developers to allocate a certain percentage of the project’s budget to creating and maintaining public art. For some countries, creating a new tax on a company's IPO value could ensure capital gains help to pay for existing (and future) public infrastructure that created the conditions for the company's existence. 
 
Direct crowdfunding and sponsorship might also be a viable financing option in some cases. GitHub recently launched [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to let individuals and companies donate directly to GitHub hosted open source projects. And there are surely other options we haven’t come across or considered here. 

Lastly, charging for use might be an option as well. For example, the DPG [ODK](https://getodk.org/) is free as a self-hosted solution for offline data collection, but the organization also provides cloud-based hosting at different pricing tiers](https://getodk.org/#odk-cloud).


The most important take-away is to think about your DPG’s financial sustainability from a project lifecycle viewpoint.  Early design and feasibility work might be funded through research grants to a partner academic institute. Seed funding might be at a low enough threshold for your agency to cover, as it was for GFDDR with GeoNode, or you might complement your investment in an external vendor with funding from a social impact investor. Philanthropic funds might help you pilot the project in particular locations, as was the case with the DHIS2, or for scaling, as was the case with [OpenSRP](https://wiki.digitalsquare.io/index.php/Digital_Square_Investments_in_Global_Goods#Notice_B_Investments) The DPG [Primero](https://www.primero.org/resources) is a collaborative effort across aid organizations and agencies that started with initial seed funding of $1.5 million from the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC). [Ongoing platform development costs are funded by UNICEF, while countries fund the costs for customizing the platform to their specific requirements](https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/946/file/Primero.pdf).
 
**KEY RECOMMENDATION**: Consider how you might approach financial sustainability differently across your DPG's project stages. Monolithic funding isn't necessarily the answer. The types and sources of available funding options might change as a project progresses. This is true for projects with relatively low funding needs as well.
