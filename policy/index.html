RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Use a well-known license as defined by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Public Good
Standard</a>. Clearly establish
copyright ownership at the onset of a project and
avoid mixing in proprietary materials, as this is not
something you want to disentangle later. Resist the temptation to
discourage commercial use of your DPG. Indeed, commercial engagement
can be very helpful to project sustainability, quality, and adoption.</p><p>EXAMPLE: The DPG <a href="https://www.mosip.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOSIP Digital ID Platform</a> chose
the <a href="https://docs.mosip.io/platform/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Public License
2.0</a>, a &#x27;weak&#x27; copyleft
license that supports a broad array of
potential business models for downstream adopters and integrators.  MOSIP felt
this approach would best attract
diverse, committed commerical partners (e.g. system integrators,
developers) to support customization, broader adoption, and
a <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/672901582561140400/pdf/Open-Source-for-Global-Public-Goods.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-sustaining contributory
ecosystem</a>
to keep the platform evolving. With the Mozilla Public License
2.0, commercial partners and
developers can create and
distribute MOSIP-supporting software under <em>any</em> license.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Decide early on whether to use trademark protection for
branding and building conformance and trust.  Whether a particular DPG should have
trademarks associated with it, and if so what the policy on ownership and
enforcement of those trademarks should be, needs to be decided on a case-by-case
basis.</p><p>EXAMPLE: The Estonian Information System Authority maintains the
trademark for the X-Road DPG, a data exchange platform, even though its continued development is
managed collaboratively across borders through the Nordic Institute
for Interoperabilty Solutions. This control helps Estonia protect
trust in its (and other&#x27;s) X-Road investments.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Do not rely on security through obscurity: secrecy doesn&#x27;t
equal security. Open-source software provides the conditions for stronger security
than proprietary software.  Evaluate how open source might bring new opportunities for
collaboration and
and cost sharing around improving security. </p><p>EXAMPLE: Organizations like the non-profit <a href="https://ostif.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Technology
Investment Fund (OSTIF)</a> connect open-source
projects with funding and logistical support for security audits and
reviews.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Build for &quot;high bar&quot; cybersecurity and
privacy regulation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) -- even if your DPG&#x27;s country of deployment doesn&#x27;t have strong
regulation -- to be in a better position to maintain a secure,
trusted DPG that protects the most vulnerable and can be adopted
beyond national borders.  Pay continuous attention to privacy and security from
the moment of project inception. Privacy
guidelines, pre-engagement diligence with vendors, and standardized
templates and contracts will help you create a trustworthy DPG and
meet the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPG standard</a>.</p><p>EXAMPLE: MOSIP&#x27;s <a href="https://www.mosip.io/uploads/resources/5c97366200053Architectural%20Principle%20-%20Privacy%20and%20Security.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design principles around security and
privacy</a>
-- reflected in its technical architecture and approach to handling
vulnerabilities, threats, and audits -- have paved the way for
adoption across countries with different regulatory environments,
including India, Philippines, Ethiopia, Guinea, Sri Lanka and Morocco.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Separate open-source DPG <em>software</em> from DPG <em>data</em> in the
minds
of high-level decision makers and elected officials to avoid misconceptions
around open approaches and privacy.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Use the power of government procurement and academic
collaborations to create open-source commons around which entrepreneurial businesses
and public-private partnerships can grow. Consider how education investments in
education -- particularly
early, comprehensive
education to improve tech skills beyond digital literacy --
can strengthen innovation and grow the talent pool.</p><p>EXAMPLE: In Rwanda, Partners in Health (PIH) and the Kigali Institute
of Science and Technology have a <a href="https://openmrs.org/2010/12/03/open-source-health-information-business-ecosystems-in-resource-poor-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership to train students to
further develop and implement the DPG OpenMRS
DPG</a>,
while the Rwandan Development Board has paired graduates with seed
capital and mentorship to help them create new health information
technology support businesses to service over 400 clinics across the
country.</p><p>This module describes key national and international policies that
shape the environment in which digital public goods (DPGs) function as
well as how to design public agency level policies to encourage use
and production of DPGs in ways that support the
requirements of the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPG
standard</a>.  It is aimed to help project
leaders and agency decision-makers implement successful DPGs, rather than to help
policymakers craft good guidelines and rules at a national level.  This module
also provides
an overview of open-source licensing.</p><p>Government policies impact every aspect of a DPG, directly and
indirectly, from the ease of creating new businesses and government
procurement to encourage specific directions in innovation and social
welfare to surveillance in the name of national security that
erodes trust with vulnerable communities.  Government policies could
encourage the creation of DPGs by linking early education investments
in open source to fostering economic development (e.g.  India), or
they could discourage DPGs by objecting to open-source encryption
methods that could help protect vulnerable populations or to openly sharing
government data to help direct services to those most in need.
Government policies work across borders as well, such as through
bilateral trade agreements or regional agreements around data
transfers, like the <a href="https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/01/asean-data-management-framework-and-model-contractual-clauses-on-cross-border-data-flows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASEAN Data Management Framework and Model
Contractual Clauses on Cross Border Data
Flows</a>.
Government policies matter because they direct national attention and
funding, set boundaries for private business and investment, and shape
a narrative around what matters and why.</p><p>In this module, we narrow in on a few high-level policy considerations
that DPGs are most likely to encounter and need to consider.  Many of
these policy considerations flow from the legal structures within
which DPG usage and production takes place.  Among these structures,
three of the most important are copyrights, patents, and trademarks.
Although these are sometimes lumped together under the term
&quot;intellectual property&quot;, it&#x27;s usually helpful to think of them
separately, as they serve very different purposes.  We will discuss
these, along with commerical use, in separate sections below.  Each
such section starts with a basic explanation of the concept.</p><p>We also briefly review Security and Data Privacy policies and touch
upon how FOSS policy can be better aligned with national education and
innovation policies.</p><p>Detailed recommendations for putting some of these policy
considerations into practice are generally found in the later modules
on <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> and
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a>.  For example,
while we touch upon procurement policy as a national-level tool here,
detailed procurement policy recommendations useful at a DPG level are
in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module, and assessing
security when evaluating an open-source project is in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a> module.  The
exceptions to this are data privacy and cybersecurity policy at a
national level, for which we also cover some recommendations here.</p><p>Again, this section&#x27;s <em>operational</em> focus does not consider how agencies
might also want to <em>advocate for changes</em> to national policies,
particularly in how relevant policies might interrelate to create an
environment more supportive of DPGs.  There are certainly points here
that are useful in that context, but we don&#x27;t delve deeply into
building a case for this advocacy angle.  Yet there&#x27;s a lot to be said
here, particularly from the standpoint of opening up a government&#x27;s
service infrastructure.  For those interested, we encourage you to
check on the example of Estonia that we include in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-examples#appendix-examples">Appendix:
Examples</a>.  Estonia&#x27;s
comprehensive, highly integrative, and open approach to e-government
is rightfully lauded, and although their origin story is unique, there
are lessons there for all governments wanting to craft a
forward-thinking integrated set of DPG supportive policies.</p><p>Before we get into context-setting national and agency level policies,
a primer on open-source licensing would be helpful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="major-software-licenses-and-license-categories">Major Software Licenses and License Categories<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#major-software-licenses-and-license-categories" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>At the most basic level, government agencies engaging with open source
can start with basic knowledge of a handful of software licenses.
Permitted software licenses under the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Public Good
standard</a> are listed in
UNICEF&#x27;s <a href="https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-candidates/blob/main/docs/licenses.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub
repository</a>.
All of these open-source licenses have in common the basic permissions
to run, copy, modify, and distribute the software, including AI
models.  They each try to create a collaborative commons and a shared
pool of value.  For all that these licenses differ from each other,
they are more alike than different.  Note that they all permit
commerical implementations, that is, they permit complanies to use the
software to make money.  Where their differences have the most impact
is in how they might restrict options for mixing software with
different licenses and for revenue generation.  This <em>might</em> matter
for your plans, and it <em>might</em> matter if you have plans to nurture
commerical implementations.</p><p>We broadly describe Free and Open Source Software (&quot;FOSS&quot;) licenses as
existing on a continuum from &quot;permissive&quot; to &quot;restrictive&quot;.  The most
permissive licenses have the fewest restrictions.  They allow the
broadest range of activity under the broadest range of conditions.
The more restrictive licenses are still quite permissive but they
condition those permissions on compliance with certain requirements.
Among the commonly used licenses, those requirements concern
&quot;copyleft&quot;, which is the requirement that when you distribute
software, open source permissions attach to some or all of your
improvements.  We usually distinguish between &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;
copyleft as a way to categorize licenses by how strict their copyleft
requirements are.</p><p>These three categories -- &quot;permissive&quot;, &quot;weak copyleft&quot;, and &quot;strong
copyleft&quot; -- are well-recognized terms in the open-source industry, and
often the first step in considering a license is to classify it with
one of those labels.  They are a common shorthand that often signal
the most salient elements of a license for many purposes.</p><p>There are three permissive licenses in common use:</p><ul><li>MIT</li><li>Several variants of BSD</li><li>Apache 2.0</li></ul><p>For most purposes, the MIT and BSD licenses are interchangeable.  In
fact, many people do not distinguish between them.  Software published
under either of these extremely permissive licenses may be used with
no significant restrictions.  Compliance with these licenses is
bureaucratic and shouldn&#x27;t ever affect the substance of a project.
For the purposes of this discussion, the key takeaway is that
permissive licenses allow you to make <em>proprietary</em> copies.  They
allow you to take open-source code and make things that themselves are
not open-source.</p><p>The Apache Software License is similarly permissive and similarly
bureaucratic.  Its primary differences from the other permissive
licenses are that it explicitly addresses patent rights.  It contains
a grant of patent rights and also conditions some rights on patent
non-assertion.  Other than that, though, its terms are for most
intents and purposes, quite similar in practical effect to the MIT and
BSD licenses.</p><p>Beyond those permissive licenses, we start to see copyleft clauses.
&quot;Copyleft&quot; is a play on words.  Whereas copyright is typically used to
prevent people from sharing software, copyleft requires that
permission to share attach to at least some of what you build.
Copyleft restricts your ability to make non-open-source software from
open-source ingredients.  It also means that companies using the
copyleft software would have to find revenue streams outside of
controlling access to the source code.  This isn&#x27;t inherently a bad
thing!  There are plenty of revenue opportunities aside from such
rent-based control, and there are good reasons to use copyleft
licensing to change incentive structures and investments downstream.
This is a bargain designed to nurture a commons of shared software --
when you distribute software that is built on code from the commons,
sometimes that newly made software must join the commons too.</p><p>We tend to describe copyleft as &quot;weak&quot; if a license only attaches
copyleft requirements to changes you make to the specific code bearing
the copyleft license.  Such licenses are fully permissive with respect
to additions or changes you make to code that merely interacts with or
relies upon weak copylefted software.  Such licenses create a commons
with respect to a specific codebase.  They do not try to maximize that
commons by including everything that builds on top of the codebase.
Such weak copyleft licenses are particularly suited for software
libraries.</p><p>There are four weak copyleft licenses in common use:</p><ul><li>Eclipse Public License 2.0</li><li>Mozilla Public License 2.0</li><li>Common Development and Distribution License 1.1</li><li>Lesser GNU General Public License</li></ul><p>That last license, the LGPL, is an outlier.  Its copyleft requirements
apply a little more often than the other weak copyleft licenses.</p><p>In contrast to weak copyleft, there are two strong copyleft licenses
that agencies should know about.  We refer to copyleft as &quot;strong&quot;
when it applies its requirements to any software that derives from the
original.  That means that it applies not just to software that
contains literal copies of the original but also to software that
links to the original.  Its theory is that when you link software
together you create a new work, and the license requires that this
entire work be open source and carry forward the copyleft
requirements.</p><p>There are two strong copyleft licenses in common use:</p><ul><li>GNU General Public License (GPL)</li><li>GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)</li></ul><p>The AGPL differs from the GPL in one major respect.  Typically,
copyleft rights flow through distribution.  When you transfer a copy
of the software, copyleft requires that you give the recipient rights
to that software.  It requires that the recipient can treat the
software they receive as open source.  This is true for both weak and
strong copyleft licenses.</p><p>AGPL takes this one step further.  It recognizes that a lot of
software runs on servers and that most of the people who interact with
that software will not receive a copy of it under normal
circumstances.  AGPL tries to correct for this by requiring that if a
user interacts with the software over a network, that user is entitled
to receive a copy of the software and all open-source rights to run,
copy, modify, and distribute it.</p><p>The DPG <a href="https://nibio.no/en/services/vips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIPS</a>, created by the
Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO), provides an
open-source platform for decision support in integrated management of
pests, diseases and weeds.  Their work is <a href="https://gitlab.nibio.no/VIPS/VIPSCommon/-/blob/4bd37abda46a0de0765ae6fd936686a1307d7d4d/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed under AGPL, with a
specific exemptions for forecasting
models</a>.
This helps them to drive open sharing and collaboration around the
core platform but supports as broad a range of local and international
forecasting models as possible, including any that might have been
developed for commercial purposes or that have restrictive licenses
for some historical reason.</p><p>The above licenses are all <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPG Standard</a>,
which references Open Source Initiative(OSI) approved licenses. OSI provides more in-depth
<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overviews of their approved licenses</a>, along with a useful
<a href="https://opensource.org/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Remember that the processes, culture, and
practices that support open-source collaboration ultimately matter
more to success than the particular open-source license.  However, the
license you choose can affect potential downstream business models.
This isn&#x27;t inherently a bad thing - indeed, these limitations were
created in order to encourage the growth of a software commons. Mapping out your
DPG&#x27;s ecosystem is a helpful
exercise here; see the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#ecosystem-mapping-for-adoptability">Adoptability</a>
module for more on ecosystem mapping.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="copyright">Copyright<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#copyright" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Copyright grants someone a monopoly on distributing copies of a
particular expressive work, such as a piece of text, some software
code, an image, a musical composition, an audio recording, a video,
etc.  Typically, that monopoly is held originally by the author, and
the author can rent or sell it to others (for example, to a
publisher).</p><p>Although there is <em>some</em> flexibility in how copyright law determines
what constitutes the work -- for example, you can&#x27;t escape copyright
by changing the characters&#x27; names in someone&#x27;s novel and distributing
the resulting work as a &quot;new&quot; novel -- the fundamental idea of
copyright is that it provides a monopoly on distribution of a
<em>specific</em> expressed work, never a monopoly on ideas or methods.  For
example, you can copyright the text of a particular recipe for making
onion soup, but you cannot copyright the actual <em>method</em> of making
onion soup, and if someone else decides to write down the same method
using different words, your copyright monopoly cannot prevent that.
(Monopoly on methods and mechanisms is instead the domain of patent
law, which we discuss <a href="#patent">elsewhere</a> in this module.)</p><p>Thus open-source licenses are simply formal statements by the
copyright holder, granting explicit permission to copy and share
without limitation, including sharing modified versions.  open-source
licenses originated with software, and therefore the most mature body
of legal texts related to open licensing is found there (the
non-software &quot;open content&quot; licenses are somewhat more recent,
although at this point the oldest ones have existed for more than a
decade and they have, like open-source software licenses, undergone
some revisions).  Importantly, the permission to share modified
versions has been present since the beginning.  With software, the
modifications one usually wants to make are things like fixing bugs or
adding new features, and of course it&#x27;s not enough to just make these
improvements in one&#x27;s own copy of the code -- one must be able to
share those improvements with others in order for the code to truly be
a digital <em>public</em> good.</p><p>Copyright is the main concern of the common open-source licenses, and
most of the terms in them are about copyright permissions.  This is
because in the absence of explicit permissions, copyright law would be
an obstacle to sharing software source code.  In most jurisdictions,
copyright prohibits permissionless sharing and re-use by default,
whereas the point of open-source licensing is to allow that sharing
and re-use, that is, to create an environment with a different
default.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="copyright-policy">Copyright Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#copyright-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>From a policy perspective, there are a few major points to keep in
mind about copyright and DPGs:</p><ul><li><p>Use only well-known open-source or open content licenses.</p><p>When publishing a DPG, you should always publish it under one of the
well-known and widely-used existing licenses as defined in the
<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Public Good
Standard</a>.  Never make up
your own license: even if you have excellent lawyers draft it, no
one else will be familiar with your new license, and thus others&#x27;
ability to use your DPG will be impeded by an unnecessary extra
burden of license evaluation.  For the same reason, avoid the rarer
licenses except when you have a specific and strong reason to prefer
one of them.</p></li></ul><p>A note about public domain open source.  It exists, and by its name it
sounds promising.  However, using it is not desirable because it does
not provide an explicit license, which is problematic for various
reasons; see <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#resources-and-tools-policy">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a> for
more about this.  These reasons are why the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Public Goods
Alliance requires an Open Source Initiative approved
license</a> for software.</p><ul><li><p>Establish copyright ownership clearly.</p><p>Open-source licenses are still copyright licenses, and therefore
they assume that the licensed work has a copyright holder.  It does
not always matter greatly who that holder is: in some circumstances,
it might be most appropriate for the public agency responsible for a
DPG to be the holder; in other circumstances, perhaps it makes sense
for the vendor who produced the DPG to be the copyright holder; in
still other circumstances, the best solution might be that every
contributor retains copyright ownership to their contribution, and
thus the copyright on the work as a whole is held by a mixture of
people.</p><p>The question of which of these copyright ownership scenarios is best
for a given DPG is discussed further in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module. The high-level
policy point here is merely that the decision of copyright
<em>ownership</em> -- which is independent from the choice of license --
should be made purposefully, not determined by accident based on who
drafted a contract or on some quirk of jurisdiction.</p></li><li><p>Avoid mixing proprietary materials into a DPG.</p><p>  It is easy to accidentally incorporate proprietary material -- that
is, any copyrighted material that is <em>not</em> under an open-source (or
open-content) license -- into a DPG.  Such incorporation most often
happens through inattention: a resource is convenient and speeds up
development of the DPG, and only long after it has been integrated
does someone check the license and discover that the resource is not
redistributable in a way that is compatible with DPGs.  There are
also occasionally popular third-party code libraries that were
formerly open-source but whose most recent releases are not open-source;
this is easy to find out by just checking the license, but one must
remember to do so.</p><p>  As the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module discusses, it is good to
write the no-proprietary-materials requirement into contracts with
vendors, so that there is no ambiguity on the matter.</p><p>  <strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Use a well-known license as defined by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Public Good
Standard</a>. Clearly establish
copyright ownership at the onset of a project and
avoid mixing in proprietary materials, as this is not
something you want to disentangle later. </p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="copyright-and-jurisdiction">Copyright and Jurisdiction<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#copyright-and-jurisdiction" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>It is likely that these open-source licenses operate in standard ways
across most countries.  Copyright law is somewhat standardized among
Berne Convention signatory countries, and most commentators treat open-source
licenses as having the same effect regardless of jurisdiction.
At the same time, these licenses were written primarily with United
States law in mind. Few licenses have been the subject of
official, judicial interpretation.  The one exception is version 3 of
both the GPL and the AGPL.  These were intentionally written to achieve the same result
in every country.  The GPL family of licenses have also been the
subject of litigation in multiple jurisdictions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="patent">Patent<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#patent" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>A patent is also a monopoly right, like a copyright, but it is a
monopoly on a method or a mechanism for doing something.  Like
copyrights, patents can be sold or rented.  However, patents are much
harder to acquire than copyrights.  The author of a new expressive
work automatically gets copyright to it (in most jurisdictions),
usually without any special registration required.  On the other hand,
to obtain a patent one must write a long proposal to the national
patent office, pay a fee, explain how one&#x27;s invention is truly new and
not merely a widely-known or easily-discovered technique for those
already working in the relevant fields, take it through a rather
complex evaluation process, and even after the patent is granted -- if
it is granted, which is not guaranteed -- it may face challenges from
those who argue that it was wrongly granted and should be
retroactively canceled.</p><p>In general, makers and distributors of DPGs should not create new
patents related to those DPGs.  Since the purpose of a DPG is to be
usable by the public at large, there would be no point monopolizing
the methods or mechanisms embodied in the DPG.</p><p>This does not mean, however, that DPGs are unaffected by patents.
It&#x27;s always possible that some random third party might have a patent
claim on some technique used in a given DPG.  The authors of the DPG
may not even be aware of this at the time they make the DPG.
Furthermore, if the patent holder decides to initiate a claim of
patent infringement, it may choose to do so against a user of the DPG
rather than against the makers or distributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="patent-policy">Patent Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#patent-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>There is no policy one can have that guarantees protection from such
infringement claims, but fortunately they are fairly rare.</p><p>However, one can at least take some steps when procuring a DPG to
ensure that everyone involved in building it or in being an official
distributor takes steps to avoid being a source of patent infringement
claims themselves.  This is discussed further in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="trademark">Trademark<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#trademark" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Trademarks are quite different from both copyrights and patents.
Trademarks are fundamentally about preventing fraud, particularly
identity fraud.</p><p>The motivating idea of trademark law is that people need to be able to
know whom they are dealing with and to know the provenance of the
goods they obtain.  Thus, you cannot sell canned beans under the
&quot;Subira Foods&quot; label unless you actually <em>are</em> Subira Foods (or unless
you have arranged a trademark usage license with Subira Foods).</p><p>The purpose of these laws is not to protect the companies, but rather
to protect the <em>public</em>.  The public wishes to know accurately who
they are dealing with.  If Subira Foods makes delicious foods,
practices good sanitation, etc, then that company will acquire a good
reputation -- but only if their name cannot be misleadingly used by
others.  If some other company (whose food is less delicious and less
sanitary) could sell their products under the name and logo of Subira
Foods, then it would be impossible for people to associate the good
reputation with a particular stable source.</p><p>Trademarks are traditionally defended by their owners only because the
owner is the entity with the strongest motivation to defend it.
Subira Foods does not want its reputation damaged by impostors, and
Subira Foods as a company probably cares far more about this than any
individual customer of Subira Foods cares about it.  Thus, trademark
law harnesses the self-interest of organizations (protection of their
reputations) to promote a public good (knowing whom we&#x27;re dealing
with).</p><p>Because of this very specific purpose, the state-granted monopoly in
trademark law is less strict than in copyrights and patents.  While a
trademark&#x27;s owner has the ability to prevent others from using the
trademarked name or logo <em>in commerce</em>, the owner cannot generally
prohibit usage in other contexts.  In particular, trademark law in
most jurisdictions permits anyone to use the trademarked names (and
even logos under certain circumstances) to merely <em>refer</em> to the
associated company or product.  In other words, while you can&#x27;t sell
beans under the name Subira Foods, you can write a newspaper article
criticizing Subira Foods and using their name in doing so.  Such
referential use (so-called &quot;nominal use&quot;) is permitted because no
impersonation or other fraud is involved, and therefore the public is
not harmed.  You are simply referring to something by its widely-known
name.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="trademark-policy">Trademark Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#trademark-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>The policy implications of trademarks for DPGs are actually fairly
simple:</p><p>It is okay for an organization to have a trademark on the name or logo
of a DPG (or of some aspect of a DPG).  In some cases it may even be
desirable: while a DPG can be &quot;forked&quot; -- that is, anyone can make a
divergent version with their own changes, perhaps even with changes
that the original authors disagree with (see the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a> module for more on this topic) -- it may be
beneficial to the public to force the fork to distinguish itself
clearly from the original, that is, to avoid being an impostor.
Trademarks can be powerful tools for preventing abuse and thus
protecting trust in a DPG&#x27;s brand.  Indeed, the technology industry has
a <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/trademarks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long history in using trademark protection of open-source
products</a> in this way.
Trademark for the DPG <a href="https://www.sunbird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunbird</a> is managed
by the EkStep Foundation, which is the main supporter and developer of
the extensible Sunbird Learning and knowledge management platform.
The Estonian Information System Authority maintains the trademark for
the X-Road DPG, even though its continued development is now done
collaboratively across borders through the Nordic Institute for
Interoperabilty Solutions.</p><p>Of course, it would be bad for trademarks associated with a DPG to be
held by a company that intends to use them to squash competing
commercial activity.  But even then, there is a limit to how much
damage such a company could do, because at most it can monopolize
usage of those labels in commerce.  If the company&#x27;s behavior annoys
too many other users and distributors of the DPG, those others will
eventually band together and start distributing the DPG under another
name and logo.  Thus, trademark enforcement that works against the
public&#x27;s interest is still only an inconvenience at worst.  It cannot
stop circulation and usage of the DPG, in the end; it might, at most,
force a change of the DPG&#x27;s name.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Decide early on whether to use trademark protection for
branding and building conformance and trust.  Whether a particular DPG should have
trademarks associated with it, and if so what the policy on ownership and
enforcement of those trademarks should be, needs to be decided on a case-by-case
basis.</p><p>The <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a> includes more
tips on trademark policy. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="commercial-use">Commercial Use<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#commercial-use" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Policy makers are sometimes tempted to try to discourage commercial
use of DPGs.  This temptation is understandable, since profit-based
use and redistribution <em>can</em> sometimes lead to behaviors that do not
benefit the public, but the temptation should be resisted.  On the
whole, commercial investment in DPGs is usually beneficial, because
commercial entities have more reasons to work collaboratively on the
DPG than to try (and likely fail) to monopolize its value.</p><p>The open-source (and open-content) licenses that govern DPG distribution
also set up an implicit economic structure that leans toward
collaboration.  Because no entity can monopolize the DPG itself -- by
definition, a DPG is available to all the public on equal terms -- any
entity that attempts to monopolize access to a particular set of users
faces a difficult challenge: it would be in the interests of all the
<em>other</em> commercial entities investing in that DPG to collaborate in
order to compete with the would-be monopolist, and a single entity
cannot match the resources of an alliance.  Of course, this same logic
applies to every similarly-situated entity.</p><p>There is still competition, of course.  It&#x27;s just that the competition
takes place in areas that are external to the DPG itself: for example,
in quality of service, in supplying other related services, in
navigating the procurement processes of potential customers, etc.
Meanwhile, some of those entities will acquire revenue streams that
depend in part on the DPG, and when they make a profit it will often
be economically sensible for them to invest a portion of those profits
back into improving the DPG.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Resist the temptation to discourage commercial
use of your DPG. Indeed, commercial engagement can be very helpful to
project sustainability, quality, and even adoption.</p><p>The <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module discusses the
usefulness of using different commercial vendors simultaneously to
improve project health, and the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/community#community-and-ecosystem">Community</a> module also notes
the relationship between commerical participation and project health
and sustainability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="security">Security<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#security" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>More digitization, more data, more things going digital and generating
more data -- the non-stop growth of our digital world means security
vulnerabilities will also grow.  This section covers security at a
policy level, meaning national level security policies to which your
DPG will likely need to adhere and agency-level policies that you
should implement to maximize security.  To learn more about assessing
the security of an existing open-source project-- and what you&#x27;ll need
to consider in creating your own -- see the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a>  module. Deeper
considerations for creating secure applications are
beyond the scope of the paper, but we do share some resources relevant
to security and coding in the open in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a>.</p><p>Before we get into some details around security policy, let&#x27;s address
two questions.  First, the question of security and open-source
software.  You&#x27;ll likely be asked this by government administrators,
others within your organization, and maybe even your most important
stakeholders: the vulnerable populations you serve.  Second, the
question of how to adequately invest in security despite a
resource-and-capacity strained environment.</p><p>Unfortunately, software systems can never be fully secure (for reasons
we don&#x27;t have space to cover here, but see the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a> for
a few thoughts), and neither open-source nor closed-source software is
a priori more secure.  What is true about open-source software is that
its unique properties can more easily lead to its being more secure in
more situations with more frequency.  This is not an automatic
assumption to make, but the conditions are there.  First, open-source
security is more easily independently verifiable.  The code can be
audited by anyone, including security experts and members of your user
community, which can be great for building trust.  Problems can be
immediately fixed independently too (if there&#x27;s the available talent
to do the work), rather than relying on a private company to
prioritize the security concern.  While private companies certainly
invest in security for their proprietary products, there is a lot of energy around bringing
cooperative, transparent attention to the problem of security in
open-source software.  For example, the non-profit <a href="https://ostif.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Technology
Investment Fund (OSTIF)</a> connects open-source
projects with funding and logistical support for security audits and
reviews.  The Linux Foundation, which has supported security audits
and reviews across its open-source projects for some time, recently
combined funding and security resources with OSTIF in this area. The
Linux Foundation also supports the <a href="https://openssf.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Security
Foundation</a>, which is trying to address
open-source security at a systems level.  The Mozilla Foundation provides
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/secure-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awards-based funding for security
audits</a>, as
does the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Technology
Fund</a>.</p><p>Still, the open-source vs.  closed-source question around security
isn&#x27;t simple, so we&#x27;ve included additional resources in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix:
Resources and
Tools</a> for
further reading.</p><p>We also recognize that working in a low-resource environment can make
the security and privacy investments we outline here seem out of touch
-- and out of reach.  Everyone working to create DPGs wants strong
security and privacy to protect vulnerable populations, which have the
most to lose from any failure.  This area is ripe for more
coordination and collective investment.  The open-source approach
shines again here. Indeed, the DPG OpenMRS found that the
communities forming around the project have <a href="https://openmrs.org/2010/12/03/open-source-health-information-business-ecosystems-in-resource-poor-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;taken on a movement of
self-organization&quot;</a>,
sharing resources and tips in a self-reinforcing cycle of improvement.
We foresee the development of more templates geared towards
low-resource environments by DPG type (e.g.  healthcare versus
education), with pooled resources to run security assessments (for
project/product planning) and audits (to confirm security standards
are met). There are great opportunities for local businesses in this
area. We&#x27;ve provided what we believe are the most important agency and
project level policies for DPGs to consider around security (and
privacy) -- basically a deeper operational dive that aligns with the
<a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Principles for Digital
Development</a>
-- but you can use these in ways that fit your capabilities.  Remember
that many mitigations can be phased, especially those you deem low
risk and low probabilty.</p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: Having made the above point about low-resource
environments, it would be good to also add some material about
possible resources or next steps.  UNICEF might know more about what
coordination, capacity building and support might be available for
such environments?  Or perhaps might even have, or have in the future,
a program of their own that might be suitable?</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Do not rely on security through obscurity: secrecy doesn&#x27;t
equal security. Open-source software provides the conditions for stronger security
than proprietary software.  Evaluate how open source might bring new opportunities
for collaboration and
and cost sharing around improving security. </p><p>Looking at your DPG ecosystem, are there possible partnerships and joint
funding for security audits of the common open-source software on
which stakeholders rely? How about help for collectively creating and
managing security assessments? How might this link into local or national government
investments in innovation, either around new government services or to
encourage local business growth?</p><p>National cybersecurity policy provides regulations to which you must
adhere as well as guides and resources that can help, such as support
for <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware-and-ransomware-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handling ransomware
attacks</a>.
National policy also helps coordinate R&amp;D to protect national
security, creates mechanisms for overseeing cybersecurity incidents,
defines cybercrimes, and drives investment in critical infrastructure.
It&#x27;s often intertwined with laws and regulation around data rights and
protection -- particularly the rights of children in digital life,
including protecting them from exploitation and abuse (see
<a href="#data-privacy">Privacy</a> below).  For example, Ghana passed the
<a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.gh/documents/Cybersecurity%20Act%202020%20(Act%201038).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cybersecurity Act
2020</a>
that addresses cyberstalking, child pornography, and sex trafficking.</p><p>Cybersecurity is increasingly understood as a cross-sector
international concern.  Efforts to increase international coordination
and harmonization have been underway for some time, especially around
data protection and privacy (see the European Union General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of
Personal Data), but if you operate across national jurisdictions,
you&#x27;ll have multiple regulations with which to comply.  Still, some
national jurisdictions have yet to fully develop cybersecurity
regulations.  As of May 2020, the Convention of the African Union on Cybersecurity and
Personal Data (2014) has only been ratified by eight of out 55 African
members.  <a href="https://unctad.org/topic/ecommerce-and-digital-economy/ecommerce-law-reform/summary-adoption-e-commerce-legislation-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNCTAD
reports</a>
that only 39 out of 54 African countries have regulations around
cybercrime, while only 28 have privacy and data protection laws.
South Africa and Ghana are some of the exceptions here.</p><p>Compliance will be very case dependent.  Much of it will revolve
around what kind of data your DPG handles and for what kind of
application (e.g. healthcare or financial services, as noted in the
<a href="#data-privacy">Privacy</a> section below).  The good news is that aside from particulars around
data protection and cybercrime, most cybersecurity regulation follows
some basics, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/risk/articles/global-cybersecurity-compliance-integrity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as summarized by
Deloitte</a>,
a consulting company with operations in over 150 countries and
territories:</p><ul><li><p>A risk-assessment based approach to understanding security threats
and implementing security programs to address these threats</p></li><li><p>Governance structures to drive accountability for these security
programs</p></li><li><p>Identification of systems that are subject to enhanced security
controls</p></li><li><p>Monitoring for breaches (successful or otherwise)</p></li><li><p>Establishing incident and escalation programs to identify and
respond to breaches and notify regulators and affected individuals
in a timely manner</p></li><li><p>Periodically testing your security program</p></li></ul><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Build for &quot;high bar&quot; cybersecurity and
privacy regulation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) -- even if your DPG&#x27;s country of deployment doesn&#x27;t have strong
regulation -- to be in a better position to maintain a secure,
trusted DPG that protects the most vulnerable and can be adopted
beyond national borders. </p><p>Like data privacy, security is an ongoing, dynamic process that
requires constant attention in order to be responsive to an ever-changing environment.<br>
<!-- -->There is a surfeit of information online about
how to protect and improve security at the agency and DPG level, and
we link to a few useful additional resources in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix:
Resources and
Tools</a>.
However, the next section provides a brief distillation of the
essential agency-level policies that will help you meet the
risk-assessement focus requirement of most cybersecurity regulation
and maximize your DPG&#x27;s security in practice: threat modeling,
security risk assessments, cost/benefit analyses, and risk management
plans.</p><p>Note that there&#x27;s a lot of unintentionally sloppy use of security
related terms that actually have very precise meanings to software
engineers.  To try to keep it simple, an asset is the thing you&#x27;re
trying to protect, with &quot;thing&quot; being very broadly defined.  A threat
is what you&#x27;re trying to protect against.  Per the U.S.  National
Institute of Standards and Technology, a
<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vulnerability</a> is
a &quot;weakness in an information system, system security procedures,
internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or
triggered by a threat source.&quot; There are different definitions of
risk, but basically it&#x27;s the potential for loss and the probability of
this occurring (loss multiplied by probability).  (The ISO definition
of risk, which the <a href="https://info.undp.org/sites/ERM/Shared%20Documents/UNDP%20ERM%20Guide_Sept2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNDP also
follows</a>
is &quot;the effect of uncertainty on objectives&quot;.)  There are also
sophisticated models out there for calculating risk.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Define security related terminology and
encourage proper usage in your team -- and vendors -- to avoid
miscommunication, mistakes and wasted effort.</p><p><strong>Threat Modeling</strong> is the ongoing process through which you -- in
collaboration with stakeholders, ideally including security experts --
identify potential threats, estimate a rank of their severity, and
start outlining possible mitigations.  Threat modeling can be done
from perspectives that center on a systems or asset view, but also
from &quot;thinking with your evil hat on&quot;: in other words, thinking
through all the ways users could be put at risk by bad actors (indeed,
one specific threat modeling exercise is called &quot;persona non grata&quot;).
This should start very early in the development process.  At some point, it can be helpful to
bring in representation from those who stand to lose the most from a
security issue.  You can think of this as a part of essential
user experience design.  Without a clear focus on your most vulnerable
users, projects will very often focus only on immediately
understandable technical security concerns
and not think through the ways someone with creative, malicious intent
could thwart protections.</p><p>You should incorporate threat modeling exercises throughout
development and deployment.  These should be formal and in-depth early
in development, and well documented, so you can revisit these later in
more &quot;light touch&quot; ways to reconfirm their validity and adjust your
path, if needed.  Your threat model should be updated when there&#x27;s any
significant change to the project, including operational changes like
switching vendors.  Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Software Engineering Institute
has published an <a href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=524448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of the most common threat modelling
approaches</a>
from asset, system, and persona perspectives, including STRIDE, DREAD,
PASTA, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and LINDDUN.  The
data flow map you will have created as part of putting your privacy
policy into practice will be useful to many of these approaches (see <a href="#data-privacy">Privacy</a>
below).</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Make sure your threat model is well
documented, kept updated, and revisited often.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Although it might seem counterintuitive, open
collaboration around identifying security threats -- and their
potential mitigations -- can improve a DPG&#x27;s security and build trust
with stakeholders.  This might not be true in every case, but we
encourage you to think of how crowdsourcing input can amplify your
capacity and breadth of knowledge.  Of course, such collaborations
would obviously need to have the problem tuned to the right audience.</p><p><strong>Security risk assessments</strong> help you determine the risk and &#x27;cost of
loss&#x27; of regulatory non-compliance as well as of the previously
identified security threats (which don&#x27;t necessarily equate 1:1 with
regulatory non-compliance).  Security risk assessments are geared to
be more diagnostic and forward-looking and aim to help you in project
planning, as opposed to the security audits we note in the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a> module, which analyze if
security is meeting certain standards at a specific point in time.
There are guides and models for doing security risk assessments, such
as from the United States National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) (see <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix: Resources and
Tools</a> ), as
well as different models for calculating probability in risk.  They
can be as simple as a rating system from &quot;not likely&quot; to &quot;expected&quot;,
as the UNDP&#x27;s guidance note <a href="https://info.undp.org/sites/ERM/Shared%20Documents/UNDP%20ERM%20Guide_Sept2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Managing Risks Across UNDP Programming
and
Operations&quot;</a>
defines, to a more complicated model.  Choose whatever seems most
likely to be both fitting and usable by your team and stick to it.
The DPG <a href="https://openmrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMRS</a> took pared-down versions of
well documented and well used security standards, such as from NIST
and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to
create a <a href="https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-20-413.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security
assessment</a>
that made more sense for on-the-ground circumstances.</p><p>You&#x27;ll also come up with potential treatments for each risk.  Remember
to include &quot;do nothing&quot; along with proactive and reactive options, as
you&#x27;ll want to evaluate a full range of mitigations as part of the
cost/benefit analysis.  Often, the best mitigation is simple, like
providing specific guidance to users so they can avoid a potential
issue.</p><p>Next is the <strong>cost/benefit analysis</strong>, which is often the most
difficult part of implementing good security policies.  A thoughtful,
inclusive cost/benefit analysis will help you prioritize across risks
and help your team to get on the same page around how risk will be
handled.  In a cost/benefit analysis, you&#x27;ll work through the cost of
each risk along with the cost of each viable way of protecting against
this risk.  Costs can be direct as well as indirect, and remember that
costs aren&#x27;t always just pecuniary.  There are costs to trust and your
&quot;brand&quot; (trademarked or not), or to your current or future capacity.</p><p>This exercise is tough.  You&#x27;ll be combining quantitative information
along with subjective analyses, which is always tricky, and you&#x27;ll be
defining the boundaries of the risks you&#x27;re willing -- and able -- to
take.  But slogging through this will help you decide which
mitigations to choose and, possibly, how these investments might be
phased.</p><p>Lastly, DPGs should have a policy of requiring a <strong>risk management
plan</strong> for all discrete projects.  As its name implies, a risk
management plan is a key tool to ensure your DPG is continually
monitoring for risks and prepared to respond in a predetermined,
agreed upon way.  Again, the <a href="https://info.undp.org/sites/ERM/Shared%20Documents/UNDP%20ERM%20Guide_Sept2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNDP&#x27;s guidance note &quot;Managing Risks
Across UNDP Programming and
Operations&quot;</a>
is useful.  Its outline of key points in any risk management plan
include:</p><ul><li><p>Risk identification: risks and their types</p></li><li><p>Treatment and escalation: what&#x27;s the response and who&#x27;s accountable</p></li><li><p>Monitoring and review: how, when, and by whom</p></li><li><p>Recording and reporting: create a risk register</p></li><li><p>Communication and consultation: How and when should this happen and
how to ensure inclusivity</p></li></ul><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Create standardized templates for threat
modeling, security risk assessments, cost/benefit analyses, and risk
management plans to help meet security regulation and improve security
in practice.  This is an area where a DPG&#x27;s open, collaborative
approach is again helpful, and secrecy is not your friend.</p><p>These security templates and their confirmed use can also help
high-risk DPGs meet grant requirements and might even help attract
additional funding and resources for security reviews.  Indeed, many
grant Requests for Proposals (RFPs) require applicants to describe in detail how they will
protect user data: See, for example, an open data RFP from the <a href="https://s31207.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/09/RFP-Language_23-Sept-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lacuna

(UNCTAD), most countries have at least some data privacy and
protection laws in place around personally identifiable information
(<a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">128 out of 194
countries</a>,
as of February 2020).  To those building a DPG that will be deployed
solely to people from one of the countries that does <em>not</em>
specifically regulate data privacy (and/or will be deployed from
within that country), we still recommend that you build around global
privacy principles and follow existing data privacy regulation (as the
India based <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/avyantra-health-technologies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neonatal health diagnostics DPG Avayana
did</a>).
Although not explicitly called out in the SDGs, privacy is a
fundamental human right recognized in the UN Declaration of Human
Rights, among other international and regional treaties.  The EU&#x27;s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a great place to start,
as it&#x27;s most established, well documented with best practices on
adherence, has some enforcement history, and is familiar to many
vendors.</p><p>As an aside, policy makers, legislators, and other people far from the
technical details are often fuzzy on the distinction between software
and the data used by that software.  As a result, when they learn that
there&#x27;s a plan to use open-source software to manage sensitive data,
they may worry because they heard that open source means that anyone
can &quot;see the code&quot;, and therefore the data is exposed. This is not true.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Separate open-source DPG <em>software</em> from DPG <em>data</em> in the
minds
of high-level decision makers and elected officials to avoid misconceptions
around open approaches and privacy.</p><p>Many aspects of a DPG&#x27;s success rely on getting data privacy right,
from building trust with end users to attracting funding.  Data
privacy is complex, but perhaps the most important recommendation is
that protecting privacy requires continuous attention.  Data privacy
is not a &quot;one and done&quot; effort.  It depends upon a close understanding
of the full lifecycle of data within the DPG project, thinking through
privacy <em>from</em> whom and <em>for</em> whom, and under what (possibly changing)
circumstances.  Recent controversy over the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and the Government of Bangladesh&#x27;s
registration program for Rohingya refugees underscores the complexity
and sensitivity.</p><p>UNICEF approached data protection and privacy extremely carefully with
the DPG <a href="https://www.primero.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primero</a>, an open-source platform
that helps social services, humanitarian and development workers
manage protection-related data, with live deployments in thirteen
countries and dozens of others underway.  UNICEF is deeply concerned
about children&#x27;s data rights and protection and adheres to the
Responsible Data for Children principles, which they helped create.
As you might imagine, the Primero platform works with significant
volumes of very sensitive information about children and their
families.  UNICEF collaborated with other agencies to create a general
<a href="https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/946/file/Primero.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rights-based approach to data
management</a>
early in the design process so security, privacy, and
rights-supporting decisions could be reflected in the product&#x27;s
architecture.  However, as legal frameworks and other needs differ
across deployments, the team instituted an additional step of creating Data Protection Impact
Assessments (see more about DPIAs under <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a>) during the
design stage of deployment customization to be sure they were fully
meeting the requirements of local regulation as well as of local aid
workers, government agencies, and the vulnerable populations they
serve.</p><p>Data privacy also depends on thoughtful design matched with
appropriate end-to-end security support.  The right privacy policies
and design won&#x27;t help you without the right underpinnings of technical
security.  When evaluating vendors, thorough pre-engagement diligence
is required to assess a vendor&#x27;s privacy and data security practices,
policies, and processes.  This is the time to find out if the vendor
has received an enforcement notice or faced any penalties or
investigations or if they&#x27;ve been involved in a data breach.  If the
vendor is a leading contributor to an open-source project, you can
also check out if that project follows the security items outlined in
the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessing-security">Adoptability</a>
module and if they keep their own house in order.  See the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-resources-tools#appendix-resources-and-tools">Appendix:
Resources and
Tools</a> for
some sample security questionnaires.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Pay continuous attention to privacy and security from
the moment of project inception.  Invest
well in your pre-engagement diligence with vendors around privacy and
security.  Create standardized data privacy and security questions for
these vendor assessments.</p><p>Your DPG will likely need to navigate data privacy and protection laws
and regulations that occur at multiple levels.  Domestic law and
regulations -- which can be at the local, state and national levels --
are largely driven by protecting consumers and citizens, especially in
areas of high sensitivity, such as personal health data.  Regional
initiatives are largely driven by the desire to harmonize privacy law
with trade and development needs (for reference, see the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development&#x27;s report Data Protection
Regulations and International Data Flows in <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-works-consulted#appendix-works-consulted">Appendix: Works Consulted</a>).  Many countries are just
beginning to enforce comprehensive data protection regulation (e.g.
Brazil, South Africa), much of it influenced by the EU&#x27;s GDPR.
Existing regulations across the globe are under revision as countries
grapple with protecting individual rights and advancing the public
good while addressing the fast pace of technology innovation and the
alarming power of large technology platforms.</p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: What are the privacy considerations -- legal and ethical -- and
related best practice recommendations around the various types of
open data, from non-personally-identifiable but user-contributed data to sensor data?</p><p>While this paper can&#x27;t review the nuances and implications of all data
privacy and protection laws, see the <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a> section below for
practical advice that we feel is applicable to all projects.</p><p>Data privacy regulations and laws are all based on the <a href="http://oecdprivacy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD&#x27;s Privacy
Principles</a> from the 1970s.  In brief, they
cover:</p><ul><li><p>Collection limitation</p></li><li><p>Data quality</p></li><li><p>Purpose specification</p></li><li><p>Use limitation</p></li><li><p>Security safeguards</p></li><li><p>Openness</p></li><li><p>Individual participation</p></li><li><p>Accountability</p></li></ul><p>There are well-tested, comprehensive design guides distilled from
years of experience developing successful products that support the
OECD&#x27;s Privacy Principles and its various derivations in national laws
and regulations.  The approach in these guides is described as
&quot;privacy by design&quot;.</p><p>The World Bank&#x27;s Identification for Development initiative summarizes
a privacy by design approach as one that:</p><ul><li><p>Develops proactive â€” not reactive â€” systems that take a preventative,
not remedial, approach</p></li><li><p>Makes privacy the default setting, rather than requiring affirmative
action</p></li><li><p>Embeds privacy into the technical design from the start rather than
retrofitting it</p></li><li><p>Views privacy in a positive-sum manner (&quot;win-win&quot;) and not as a
zero-sum (&quot;either/or&quot;)</p></li><li><p>Develops end-to-end security with a view to full-lifecycle
protection</p></li><li><p>Builds-in visibility and transparency and keeps systems open and
accountable</p></li><li><p>Keeps the system user-centric, with an eye to respecting user data
privacy</p></li></ul><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Following privacy by design guidelines can help you pay
attention to the actual needs of your end users to create a successful
DPG while also building for legal and regulatory compliance (and
meeting the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPG standard</a>).</p><p>The World Bank&#x27;s brief <a href="https://www.id4africakhub.org/post/privacy-by-design-current-practices-in-estonia-india-and-austria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ID4D
research summary</a>
highlights the legal, operational, and technical controls used
in Estonia, India, and Austria to protect privacy and security. <a href="https://www.eesti.ee/et" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estonia&#x27;s Citizen
Portal</a> is a great example of an open-source project that has
followed privacy by design guidelines, particularly in how it gives
users visibility -- and control -- over their data.  Estonia&#x27;s
Personal Data Usage Monitor service lets users see who&#x27;s accessed
their personal data, control which data is shared with whom, monitor
for unauthorized usage of their data, and question unsanctioned
access.  This transparency improves trust and accountability in the
service, which is further underscored with real consequences for data
privacy breaches, including firing public sector
employees.</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Impact Alliance&#x27;s Principles for Digital
Development</a>
provides further practical guidance to implementing privacy at
different stages of a project.  During the design and develop phase,
consider how your prototyping work could improve alignment with
privacy principles -- such as putting users first, especially those
most vulnerable -- as well as help you to create and test a data
management and security plan.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: An early prototype that works with dummy or
live data (but not data at scale) can help better align DPG to good
data practices.  Building and testing a prototype early in the
development cycle helps surface problems and can better protect users
and save resources down the line.</p><p>As you read through privacy guidelines, consider how the open aspects
of your DPG project can help you better understand and build for
privacy.  Recall that all areas of project &quot;openness&quot; are points of potential
collaboration to help you build a better product.  For example, could collaboratively
writing documentation with more marginalized users help identify previously overlooked privacy concerns? </p><p>The DPG <a href="https://okyapp.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oky</a> is a menstruation and health

aspects of the DPG project can strengthen its data privacy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="gdpr">GDPR<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#gdpr" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>The EU&#x27;s GDPR is a comprehensive set of data protection and privacy
regulation that defends the privacy rights of approximately 446
million EU citizens and residents, with special attention to the
rights of and protection for children and <a href="https://euconsent.eu/euconsent-consortium-awarded-european-commission-funding-to-create-a-child-rights-centred-cross-border-system-for-online-age-verification-and-parental-consent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding for related pilot
projects</a>.
GDPR replaced the conflicting and overlapping set of EU state-specific
regulation and is centered in a long history of privacy and human
rights law.  It&#x27;s deeply influenced data privacy and protection laws
in other countries, such as India and Brazil.  It can also impact
non-EU organizations.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: If you are offering goods and services to EU
citizens or digitally monitoring their behavior in some way, there are
few exceptions to the requirement to adhere to GDPR.  Arguably, GDPR
also provides the highest protection for vulnerable communities, and
even DPGs that function in areas not covered by GDPR should consider
adherence.  Take advantage of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR compliance guidance published by the
EU</a>, including the easy-to-understand <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR compliance checklist</a>.

children&#x27;s
privacy</a>.</p><p>Regardless of any desire to be GDPR compliant, every DPG should have
standardized contracts. These service agreements should require that
vendors implement adequate security risk planning and mitigations and
place restrictions on how data provided to them in order to peform the
contracted service can be used, retained, and stored.  The Estonian
government&#x27;s recent <a href="https://rosai-it.org/news/newsletter/1-2021/updates-from-itwg-members/estonia-x-road-and-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audit of
X-Road</a>
found that many national agencies didn&#x27;t use data service agreements
or rarely checked for compliance where they were in place.
Alarmingly, no audited national agency confirmed that their suporting
vendors had adequate processes in place to ensure data integrity and
confidentiality and to mitigate security risks.  See the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-sample-contract#appendix-sample-contract-language">Appendix:
Sample Contract
Language</a>
for examples of security and data protection contractural clauses.</p><p>Additional GDPR requirements include: </p><ul><li><p>Data protection addendums and managing &quot;subprocessors&quot;: One of
GDPR&#x27;s forward leaps is enforcing a clear, contract-based framework
of responsibility for data protection across any agency or business
that handles personal data.  To do this, GDPR requires that
contracts with specific terms are in place between a controller (in
essence, the agency that determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data) and a processor (the agency or other
body, such a vendor, that processes personal data on behalf of the
controller). (See <a href="https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/data-controllers-and-processors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU
guidance</a>
for a more detailed definition of controller and processor).  In
order to speed up the approval process and provide flexibility to
change along with data protection laws and regulation, these terms
are commonly put in a separate Data Protection Addendum (or Data
Processing Agreement), rather than in the Master Service Agreement
(see the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement#procurement">Procurement</a> module for more
on Master Service Agreements).  Key points in a data protection
addendum include requiring the vendor to adhere to security and
privacy standards and to indemnify you for costs, damages, and loss
if the contract is breached.  This
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple checklist for GDPR-compliant contracts</a>
complements the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EU&#x27;s checklist</a>.  Pay
particular attention to the requirement that the controller - likely
you - must authorize the use of <em>any subcontractors</em> to the main
processor that will handle personal data from the DPG.</p></li><li><p>Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA): Although GDPR requires
such an assessment only in potential high risk situations, such as
for an application that processes &quot;special category&quot; sensitive data
like sexual orientation or biometric data, we recommend that these
be done for any DPG that relies on personal data or that uses any
data in a way that could have significant impact on human life.<br>
<!-- -->This is a good practice that&#x27;s
common across private industry, as it helps to educate everyone
involved and shake out potential issues.  There are checklists
around DPIAs, descriptions of the DPIA process, and <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-protection-impact-assessment-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample
templates from the
EU</a> as
well as the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK

security and data protection procedures are in place.</p></li><li><p>Data mapping, or understanding the flow of data through a DPG, is a
first step in creating a DPIA.  This <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-data-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data mapping
guide</a> from a
UK-based consultant is useful.  A data map, especially a simplified
visual representation, can be very helpful in explaining the
difference between a DPG and the data it handles to higher-level
decision makers, as we recommended earlier.  It&#x27;s also an essential
tool in preparing for a data audit.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2787/guide-to-data-protection-audits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data
audits</a>
are &#x27;snapshot-in-time&#x27; checks into whether you have effective controls and
processes in place to fulfill
your data protection obligations.  They
should be performed on a regular basis.  How regular depends on the
sensitivity of the data being processed and the threat assessment.
A DPG that helps refugees find health services in a neighboring
country might have a higher threat assessment than a DPG that helps
students collaborate in online learning.</p></li></ul><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Standardizing contracts and data protection
addendums, running Data Protection Impact Assessments, data mapping
and data audits will help you meet GDPR requirements and are good
sound security policies.</p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: The original toolkit&#x27;s focus is on country-level DPGs, but
people -- and their needs -- travel across borders. Regional security and privacy
frameworks are growing, with the goal of harmonization, along with more pressure
for broader international frameworks. What are the possible implications for DPGs
at an operational and mangagement level? </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="aligning-with-education-and-innovation-policy">Aligning with Education and Innovation Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#aligning-with-education-and-innovation-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="education-policy">Education Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#education-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Policies guide investment, and there&#x27;s much to be gained by better

local technical talent</a>
is problematic for creating and sustaining
DPGs.  Early educational exposure to technology is essential to
addressing this gap, with an emphasis on actually building things to
steadily increase ICT skills.  There&#x27;s certainly a lot of
infrastructure scaffolding behind making this possible, like
consistent Internet connectivity and access to computers, as well as
more fundamental issues like food security and general safety.  But an
early and comprehensive education-focused approach to improving tech
skills beyond digital literacy and fostering local open-source tech
and innovation is imperative.  </p><p>Uzbekistan has been moving along this
developmental path, first ensuring schools have the necessariy ICT
infrastructure, like broadband access, and now revising curriculum to

<a href="https://dhis2.org/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Oslo Department of Informatics leads the development and maintenance
of the core software</a> and helps keep the project at
the forefront of academic research into the broader socio-technical ecosystem of
health information systems.
The OpenSRP DPG, a mobile platform that helps frontline health workers
deliver better healthcare, was <a href="https://smartregister.org/governance-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">founded by several design and software
engineering
students</a>.  It&#x27;s now
deployed in 17 countries, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Indonesia,
Pakistan, and Zambia.</p><p>After fundamental coding skills are in place, more sophisticated
open-source co-development tools can be integrated into curriculum and
pedagogy.  Many students will already be familiar with some tenents of
open-source collaboration, as a lot of early education coding games
and environments encourage kids to share and re-use code and projects.</p><p>Familiarity with open source will not only help students increase
their digital skills but also help them develop skills needed for
success in our deeply uncertain future, such as teamwork, critical
thinking and problem solving, and communication.  Open-source
learning doesn&#x27;t have to be just in curriculum and teaching methods.
Learning-by-doing programs, like hackathons and open innovation challenges, are
fantastic ways
to engage students in solving local problems that matter to them (and
they&#x27;re great ways to engage students in your DPG!).</p><p>Furthermore, these education-focused efforts -- especially as one
progresses towards the university level -- can be combined with national
and local policies to strengthen innovation (e.g.  innovation hubs,
R&amp;D investments, support for open science, educational grants).</p><p>In Rwanda, Partners in Health (PIH) and the Kigali Institute of
Science and Technology have a partnership to <a href="https://openmrs.org/2010/12/03/open-source-health-information-business-ecosystems-in-resource-poor-environments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train students to
further develop and implement the OpenMRS
DPG</a>,
which was adopted by the Rwandan Ministry of Health.  Graduates have
been hired to work at the Ministry.  The Rwandan Development Board has
also paired some graduates with seed capital and mentors to help them
create new health information technology support businesses to service
over 400 clinics across the country.</p><p>The <a href="https://state-of-foss.in/the-state-of-foss-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Free and Open Source Software in India
report</a>
outlines these points nicely within the context of India&#x27;s education
system and innovation capacities, making the case that increasing FOSS
literacy will also help Indian businesses to move up the value chain.</p><p>The demand for skilled developers with open-source
skills is growing.  There&#x27;s room in the international market for a
country to cultivate a speciality in filling this need by better
developing the labor force, starting at the university level, and
adopting innovation related policies to attract business investment.</p><p>Still, it&#x27;s important to note that open-source development and talent
buiding is not all about code skills and contribution and that
adjacent activities -- like creating good documentation, providing
support, user experience design, working to make a community more
inclusive, and product &#x27;evangelizing&#x27; -- are important to most project
types (see the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a>
module).  Indeed, upcoming research from the Ford Foundation found
that non-code contribution from university students in Bangladesh were
critical to making software available to more diverse, global populations.
The DPG OpenSRP project&#x27;s list of <a href="https://smartregister.org/governance-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contribution
types</a> gives you an
idea of the possible breadth of community participation.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Think through your DPG&#x27;s local ecosystem and
consider opportunities for collaboration with academia, keeping in
mind that non-coding contributions are also very valuable.  Although
building local talent takes time, early investment to improve tech skills beyond
digital literacy can strengthen innovation and grow the talent pool.</p><p>For example, could you team up with secondary schools on a series of
open-source hackathons to introduce students to your DPG and solve a few
specific problems? Is there an opportunity to collaborate with
a local university around open source, or even a local digital
strategy in which your DPG might fit? Remember that changes and
investments at a national level can happen more easily if there are proof points
at a local level.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="innovation-policy">Innovation Policy<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#innovation-policy" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>Like the process of innovation itself, innovation policies are
interactive, looping, and cumulative.  They work as a cooperative set
to better link a country&#x27;s link science, technology, and business

value.  Open-source infrastructure provides a &#x27;platform&#x27; around which entrepreneurial
businesses and ecosystems can grow. It can foster the needed
interdisciplinary, public-private collaborations to quickly
create and scale solutions to our most challenging problems.</p><p>Government procurement is a strong lever for aligning FOSS and
national innovation policy, amongst other areas of symbiotic benefits.
Government procurement has the power to shape entire markets. For developing countries
in particular, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/procurement-for-development#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">government procurement can represent a significant portion of GDP</a> and thus have a remarkable impact on a country&#x27;s
economic growth and social well-being. Government investment
to create an open, shared commons in a market -- for example, open healthcare
data and open-source software to collect, contribute, analyze, and derive public
health insights
from the data -- can catalyze transformative change by directing private resources
and industry collaborations to
areas of new ideas and growth, as identified in innovation policy goals.
Indeed, it can be argued that strategically investing public funds into open-source
digital infrastructure should be a core point of any innovation
policy. Building on the lessons from open source, we also urge policy makers to
take a broader view of innovation and recognize how openly shared resources can
drive new <a href="https://www.oecd.org/education/innovation-education/32125887.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user-led innovation networks</a>
along with traditional commerical actor-focused models. </p><p>India&#x27;s government recognizes this value, and in 2015 the Ministry of
Communication and Information Technology and Department of Electronics
&amp; Information Technology published a policy (part of three open-source-related
policies under Digital India) that mandates agencies strive to
use open-source software in all e-governance systems in order to
<a href="https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/policy_on_adoption_of_oss.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;prepare India for a knowledge based transformation into a digitally
empowered society and a knowledge
economy.&quot;</a></p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Use the power of government procurement to create
open-source commons around which innovative, entrepreneurial businesses
and public-private partnerships can grow. Government procurement is possibly the
greatest lever for more alignment between FOSS policy and national
innovation policy.  Again, Estonia&#x27;s approach to service digitization
and open source, public-private partnerships, government procurement
and its astutely comprehensive innovation policy is one to study.  At
a local level, consider your DPG&#x27;s ecosystem.  Points of
alignment between your technology needs and those of local government point
to opportunities for local innovation policy alignment.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
