Quality Assurance practices
as well as sample contract language around security and data
protection.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="sample-contract-language-open-source-quality-assurance">Sample Contract Language: Open Source Quality Assurance<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#sample-contract-language-open-source-quality-assurance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Below is an example <strong>Statement of Work</strong> for an open-source project that includes points around Open Source Quality Assurance (OSQA). </p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Following the open-sourcing of Software, Vendor proposes to assist Client State to:</p><ul><li>Monitor and improve deployability: Monitor and advise on Software&#x27;s deployability by other jurisdictions; improve Software&#x27;s deployability as needed.</li><li>Improve deployment process: Analyze, improve, and document Software&#x27;s deployment process.</li><li>Manage third-party contributions: Help manage code contributions and other contributions from third-party contributors.</li><li>Assist with public communications: Help inform governments and the civic technology community about Software&#x27;s availability and capabilities.</li><li>Plan and advise on long-term maintenance: Help find or create an appropriate long-term home for the Software source code and related assets, to support long-term maintenance while also ensuring that State&#x27;s needs with respect to Software continue to be met.  This involve forming or joining a consortium.</li><li>Develop open-source contracting and procurement language: See description below.</li><li>Advise on open source / open technology processes: See description below.</li><li>Hackathons / Events: Organize and/or assist in organizing hackathons and other events to promote actionable interest in Software.</li></ul><p>This proposed Statement of Work describes mainly ongoing processes. Although each process will likely have specific deliverables associated with it, not all of those deliverables can be predicted in advance. Therefore, this SOW proposes activities with time boundaries, not with the intention of ending the work when the time limit is reached, but to give State a scheduled checkpoint to assess the quality and direction of the work so far, with the option to extend and/or amend the contract if desired.</p><p><strong>Assistance Areas</strong></p><p>Monitor and improve deployability</p><p>Vendor will regularly monitor the deployability of the Software code and sample data, both by self-deployments and by maintaining regular contact with other parties attempting to deploy Software in real-world environments.  Where possible, Vendor will seek to improve Software&#x27;s deployability. Maintaining easy deployability is crucial in Software&#x27;s success, not only in jurisdictions outside State but, in the long run, even for State itself.  Ease of deployability ultimately means not only ease of adoption, but faster turnaround times on bug reports, greater flexibility in live deployment options, and expanded ability for others to participate in release testing.</p><p>It is typically somewhat difficult for a primary vendor who controls the live production environment to monitor generic deployability effectively. There are too many pressures on that vendor to focus all effort on deployability for the specific case of the primary client&#x27;s data in that client&#x27;s environment – even though in the long run, improved general deployability also results in improved deployability for the production environment too.  Vendor thus proposes to serve as an independent third party, ensuring that deployability standards are maintained.</p><p>Improve deployment process</p><p>Ease and standardization in Software&#x27;s deployment process are crucial for Software adoption.  The first step for any other jurisdiction interested in Software is to stand up a test instance with their own data; without a reliable, well-documented data-import and deployment process, this first step will continue to be a major hurdle.</p><p>Vendor will perform technical analysis and make technical and documentation improvements as needed to ensure that deployment is manageable for a wide range of jurisdictions and vendors.</p><p>Manage third-party contributions</p><p>Many aspects of managing incoming open-source contributions (core code, documentation, sample data, third-party deployment scripts, bug reports, etc) do not require deep technical expertise in the software.  Vendor proposes to handle, as an ongoing process, the parts of contribution management than can be separated from in-depth code review and technical decision-making.  State and Vendor would of course still make final decisions about what contributions to accept, and how, but Vendor would take care of the entry-level open-source project management bureaucracy as much as possible, including but not necessarily limited to:</p><ul><li>Day-to-day communications with participants in the project&#x27;s open-source forums;</li><li>First-pass review of contributions, to ensure proper formatting, description (log message), etc;</li><li>First-pass review of public bug reports, to have initial dialogue with the reporter, resolve duplicates, make sure proper reproduction recipes are included, answer common questions, spot trends in the user community, etc.</li><li>Monitoring of the public discussion forums, to make sure the right parties are talking to each other, to help gather a formal knowledge base (e.g., FAQ) about the software, and to flag important items for State and/or Vendor&#x27;s attention</li><li>Management of Contributor License Agreements, to make sure the project can legally and safely accept the contribution;</li><li>Management of contributors in GitHub;</li><li>Management of public-facing documentation, to the extent that deep technical knowledge of Software is not required (which we anticipate being a fairly broad extent);</li><li>Coordinate with Vendor on contributions that are being accepted into the core code for general release, to make sure that the internal development process is plugged into the public forums in ways the community can use.</li></ul><p>We believe that this semi-separable part of contribution management is probably more than half of the typical public engagement overhead of running an open-source project – speaking roughly, somewhere between 70% and 75% of that overhead.  Having Vendor handle this portion would allow Vendor to concentrate on technical review and on just the communications that directly involve core code or State-desired features, and maximize the project&#x27;s ability to get the full advantage of public engagement, which, if done right, far outweighs the overhead.  Vendor would of course remain free to become as involved with public technical engagement as they wish to be &amp; have the bandwidth to be, and Vendor would fully support them in this.</p><p>Assist with public communications</p><p>Running an open-source project with a primary stakeholder of State&#x27;s size inevitably involves moments when messaging (about the inclusion or exclusion of a core feature, for example) must be done in a careful and well-considered manner, in ways that will be comprehensible by both the open-source and civic technology communities – including government officials and other vendors.</p><p>There are more and less successful ways to send such messages.  The more successful ones leave all stakeholders feeling confident about the project and its future (even if their particular concern or bug was not addressed, or even was exacerbated).  The less successful ones leave some stakeholders feeling uncertain, and possibly reconsidering their involvement or their adoption of the software.  Vendor proposes to assist with such public communications, taking an advisory role in both drafting and reviewing them, in helping to determine which forums and media to broadcast such messages in, and in managing responses to incoming communications.</p><p>Plan and advise on long-term maintenance</p><p>The Software&#x27;s long-term maintenance may involve participation by multiple cities and vendors.  Vendor proposes to help State determine the best shape for this long-term maintenance structure and, depending on the outcome of that process, help to set it up.  This will involve discussions with State as well as with with vendors such as <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->, open technology consortia and organizations such as <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->, and others.</p><p>Vendor will provide both structural advice, negotiation help, and, if necessary, legal assistance in setting up or joining such a body, in such a way as to ensure that State&#x27;s interests are protected along with the long-term health of the Software code.  We emphasize that the success of any such consortium-based maintenance plan depends much more on the technical success and adoption of Software itself than on the particular arrangement of the consortium: no shared maintenance effort can succeed if the software itself is not successful, while even a flawed shared maintenance arrangement can still succeed quite well if the software is fundamentally healthy and in demand.</p><p>Develop open-source contracting and procurement language</p><p>Vendor will work with State to collect and analyze (from an open-source development perspective) the State&#x27;s experiences in the Software&#x27;s procurement and development contract, and suggest language or process improvements that could help build open-source practices into Software and future software projects from the start, in a way compatible with State&#x27;s existing procurement procedures.</p><p>Advise on open-source / open-technology processes</p><p>During the phase leading up to the open sourcing, we discovered that various unforeseen questions related to open-source processes and technology tend to arise.  Their exact topics and timing at least cannot be reliably predicted (for example, in the couple of weeks immediately prior to this draft SOW, we discussed open-source databases and deployment procedures in some depth, security audit contracting &amp; timing, and other things).  However, statistically, the overall rate and complexity of the questions is somewhat predictable, so we propose to simply budget for it explicitly in phase two.</p><p>Hackathons / Events</p><p>Vendor will assist State in determining what developer-oriented events (such as hackathons) would be most effective in promoting Software usage and adoption, and as appropriate organize or assist in organizing those events, including promotion, management of the event itself, and post-event results processing.</p><p>The current Statement of Work calls for one hackathon, in Fiscal Year 2019, covering both Software core development and API development.  It is possible that two hackathons (perhaps one focusing just on API usage, and another on both core and API) would be a good investment, and/or that events other than hackathons could benefit Software, but in any case we would still recommend that they happen in FY 2019.  Such events do better the more potential attendees there are already familiar with the technology in question and the longer that technology has been publicly available and discussed.  In both respects, Software will be in a better position for such events in FY 2019 than in FY 2018.</p><p>Schedule and costs</p><p>(Omitted.)</p><p><strong>Position Descriptions</strong></p><ul><li>Open Source Program Manager:</li></ul><p>Minimum general experience:  Experience as a developer and community manager on multiple open-source projects; experience releasing third-party code as open source; experience using and deploying open source software in large-scale enterprises.

relevant testing or monitoring. If Licensor suspects or becomes aware of any
unauthorized access to any Customer Data or Personal Data by any unauthorized person
or third party, or becomes aware of any other security breach relating to Personal
Data held or stored by Licensor under this Agreement or in connection with the
performance of the Professional Services or other services performed under this
Agreement or any Statement(s) of Work (&quot;Data Breach&quot;), Licensor shall immediately
notify Customer in writing and shall fully cooperate with Customer at Licensor&#x27;s
expense to prevent or stop such Data Breach. In the event of such Data Breach,
Licensor shall fully and immediately comply with applicable laws, and shall take
the appropriate steps to remedy such Data Breach. Licensor will defend, indemnify
and hold Customer, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, suits, causes
of action, liability, loss, costs and damages, including reasonable attorney fees,
arising out of or relating to any third party claim arising from breach by Licensor
of its obligations contained in this Section, except to the extent resulting from
the acts or omissions of Customer. All Personal Data to which Licensor has access
under this Agreement, as between Licensor and Customer, will remain the property
of Customer. Customer hereby consents to the use, processing and/or disclosure
of Personal Data only for the purposes described herein and to the extent such
use or processing is necessary for Licensor to carry out its duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement, any applicable Statement(s) of Work, or
as required by law. Licensor will not transfer Personal Data to third parties
other than through its underlying network provider to perform its obligations
under this Agreement. All Personal Data delivered to Licensor shall be stored
in the United States or other jurisdictions approved by Customer in writing and
shall not be transferred to any other countries or jurisdictions without the
prior written consent of Customer.</p><p><strong>Date Security Exhibit</strong>:
EXHIBIT __ Data Security</p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Master Services and
License Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached (&quot;Agreement&quot; ), and all other
Exhibits thereto, and in addition to and not in lieu of other provisions in the
Agreement and the Exhibits thereto, Licensor agrees as follows:</p><p>1.0 General Security Procedures</p><p>1.1 Without limiting Licensor&#x27;s obligation of confidentiality as further described
in the Agreement and herein, Licensor will be responsible for establishing and
maintaining an information security program that is designed to: (i) ensure the
security and confidentiality of Customer Data; (ii) protect against any anticipated
threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Customer Data; (iii)
protect against unauthorized access to or use of the Customer Data; (iv) ensure
the proper disposal of Customer Data, as further defined herein; and (v) ensure
that all subcontractors of Licensor, if any, comply with all of the foregoing.
Licensor will designate an individual to be responsible for the information
security program. Such individual will respond to Customer inquiries regarding
computer security and to be responsible for notifying Customer‐designated
contact(s) if a breach or an incident occurs, as further described herein. The
information security program will be audited annually as detailed in Licensor&#x27;s
SSAE 16 and/or SOC 1 audit reports, which will be made available to Customer upon request.</p><p>1.2 Licensor must conduct formal security awareness training, with a testing
component, for all personnel and contractors as soon as reasonably practicable
after the time of hiring or prior to being appointed to work on Customer Data
and annually recertified thereafter. Documentation of Security Awareness
Training must be retained by Licensor, confirming that this training and
subsequent annual recertification process have been completed, and available for
review by Customer.</p><p>1.3 Customer will have the right to review Licensor&#x27;s information security program
prior to the commencement of Customer&#x27;s entry of data into the Products or delivery
to Customer of any Professional Services and from time to time during the Term
of this Agreement. During the Term of the Agreement, from time to time with
proper notice and Licensor approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
Customer, at its own expense, will be entitled to perform, or to have performed,
an on‐site audit of Licensor&#x27;s information security program and facilities. In
lieu of an on‐site audit, upon request by Customer, Licensor will use reasonable
efforts to complete, within forty‐five (45 days) of receipt, an Information
Security Assessment questionnaire provided by Customer regarding Licensor&#x27;s
information security program.</p><p>1.4 In the event of any actual or apparent theft, unauthorized use or disclosure
of any Customer Data, Licensor will immediately commence all reasonable efforts
to investigate and correct the causes and remediate the results thereof, and
within two (2) business days following discovery of any such event, provide
Customer notice thereof, and such further information and assistance as may be
reasonably requested.</p><p>1.5 Customer Data, including but not limited to sales data, hosted, stored, or
held by Licensor in the Product(s) or in the platform operated by Licensor, or
on any device owned or in the custody of Licensor, its employees, agents or
contractors, will be encrypted. Licensor will not transmit any unencrypted
Customer Data over the internet or a wireless network, and will not store any
Customer Data on any mobile computing device, such as a laptop computer, USB
drive or portable data device, except where there is a business necessity and
then only if the mobile computing device is protected by industry‐standard
encryption software approved by Customer.</p><p>1.6 The parties acknowledge and agree that any disclosure of Customer Data will
in no way be construed to be an assignment, transfer, or conveyance of title to
or ownership rights in such Customer Data.</p><p>2.0 Network and Communications Security</p><p>2.1 All Licensor connectivity to Customer computing systems and all attempts at
same will be only through Customer&#x27;s security gateways/firewalls and only through
Customer‐approved security procedures.</p><p>2.2 Licensor will not access, and will not permit unauthorized persons or entities
to access, Customer computing systems and/or networks without Customer&#x27;s express
written authorization, and any such actual or attempted access will be consistent
with any such authorization.</p><p>2.3 Licensor will take appropriate measures to ensure that Licensor&#x27;s systems
connecting to Customer&#x27;s systems and anything provided to Customer through such
systems do not contain any Disabling Device. For purposes of this Agreement,
&quot;Disabling Device&quot; means any programs, mechanisms, programming devices, malware
or other computer code (i) designed to disrupt, disable, harm, or otherwise
impede in any manner the operation of any software program or code, or any
computer system or network (commonly referred to as &quot;malware&quot;, &quot;spyware&quot;, &quot;viruses&quot;
or &quot;worms&quot;); (ii) that would disable or impair the operation thereof or of any
software, computer system or network in any way based on the elapsing of a
period of time or the advancement to a particular date or other numeral (referred
to as &quot;time bombs&quot;, &quot;time locks&quot;, or &quot;drop dead&quot; devices); (iii) is designed to
or could reasonably be used to permit a party or any third party to access any
computer system or network (referred to as &quot;trojans&quot;, &quot;traps&quot;, &quot;access codes&quot;
or &quot;trap door&quot; devices); or (iv) is designed to or could reasonably be used to
permit a party or any third party to track, monitor or otherwise report the
operation and use of any software program or any computer system or network
by the other party or any of its customers.</p><p>3.0 Customer Data Handling Procedures
Erasure of Information and Destruction of Electronic Storage Media. If Customer
Data is required to be permanently deleted from any storage media owned or operated
by Licensor, all electronic storage media containing Customer Data must be wiped
or degaussed for physical destruction or disposal, in a manner meeting forensic
industry standards such as the NIST SP800‐88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization.
Licensor must maintain documented evidence of data erasure and destruction. This
evidence must be available for review at the request of Customer.</p><p>4.0 Physical Security
All backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be contained in secure,
environmentally‐controlled storage areas owned, operated, or contracted for by
Licensor and all backup and archival media containing Customer Data must be
encrypted.</p><p>5.0 Penetration Testing
Licensor will provide Customer with an annual, third party Penetration Test report.
During the term of this Agreement, Licensor will engage, at its own expense and
at least one time per year, a third party vendor reasonably acceptable to
Customer to perform penetration and vulnerability testing (&quot;Penetration Tests&quot;)
with respect to Licensor&#x27;s systems. The objective of such Penetration Tests is
to identify design and/or functionality issues in infrastructure of Licensor&#x27;s
systems that could expose Customer Data and its computer and network equipment
and systems to risks from malicious activities. Penetration Tests will probe for
weaknesses in network perimeters or other infrastructure elements as well as
weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures relating to Licensor&#x27;s systems
that could be exploited by a malicious party. Penetration Tests will identify,
at a minimum, the following security vulnerabilities: invalidated or unsanitized
input; broken access control; broken authentication and session management;
cross‐site scripting (XSS) flaws; buffer overflows; injection flaws; improper
error handling; insecure storage; denial of service; insecure configuration
management; proper use of SSL/TLS; proper use of encryption; and anti‐virus
reliability and testing. Within a reasonable period after the annual Penetration
Test has been performed, Customer may request from Licensor a report of any
high level and medium level security issues that were revealed during such
Penetration Test and subsequent certification in writing to Customer that such
high level and medium level security issues have been fully remediated. To the
extent that high level and/or medium level security issues were revealed during
a particular Penetration Test, Licensor will subsequently engage, at its own
expense, the Testing Customer to perform an additional Penetration Test within
a reasonable period thereafter to ensure continued resolution of identified
security issues and will notify Customer with the results thereof.</p><p> 6.0 Background Checks
Licensor will perform background checks on all Licensor personnel and direct hire
contractors including temporary and non‐employee personnel who will be performing
services for Customer, including but not limited to implementation services under
any Statement(s) of Work, that requires access to Customer Data pursuant to this
Agreement. Licensor will not assign any employee to perform services for Customer
who has not authorized a background investigation, or whose background
investigation has revealed the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor within the
previous seven (7) years, measured back from the time such Licensor employee
commences services pursuant to the Agreement, to the extent such felony or
misdemeanor relates to the suitability of the individual&#x27;s employment, except to
the extent prohibited by applicable law. If Licensor contracts, for any services,
with a third party that needs to be allowed or requires access to Customer Data,
the third party will undergo the same Licensor background checks as performed on
Licensor personnel and contractors under this section.</p><p>7.0 SSAE‐16/SOC‐1
Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (together with any
related agreements, including licenses and/or Statement(s) of Work) and receive
a full refund for all monies prepaid thereunder in the event that Licensor fails
to produce an acceptable SSAE‐16/ SOC‐1 Type II report.
