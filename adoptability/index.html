availability of support as well as the project&#x27;s sustainability and
responsiveness to its user base when evaluating an open-source product for
adoption.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: To understand if a project is likely to develop a
secure-as-possible product, look for: a documented process for
reporting security vulnerabilities; security patch releases; updated
third-party dependencies; and for more mature projects, possibly a Common Vulnerability
Exposure
number(s) (CVE) and a published security audit.</p><p>EXAMPLE: The financial inclusion DPG <a href="https://mifos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mifos</a> has a
<a href="https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-21385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE</a> related to the
Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX. The problem has been
fixed, but the public documentation is a sign of a mature project that
takes security seriously and is willing to enlist the support of
global security researchers and developers to build a better
product. The DHIS2 DPG also publishes <a href="https://dhis2.org/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVEs, along with a clear
process for reporting vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: If possible, work with vendors that can show solid, public
evidence of their contributions to the project. The existence of multiple, diverse
vendors providing commercial
support is practically a guarantee that the product is as stable and
reliable as possible, while looking through public reviews and the
bug report database will give you additional insight into a product&#x27;s
stability and reliability.</p><p>EXAMPLE: The digital ID DPG <a href="https://www.mosip.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOSIP</a> supports a
thriving community of several dozen commercial partners, such as
<a href="https://www.mosip.io/resource-partners/mosip-integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systems integrators and biometric solution
providers</a>. </p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Thorough product installation and initial configuration
documentation indicates
a product that&#x27;s actually meant to be used. Also ensure that documented
Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) are available. These are necessary to the full
range of the programmatic
functionality you&#x27;ll probably need, especially if you will work with
data at scale (although a lack of published APIs isn&#x27;t uncommon for
early stage open-source products, but if this is the case, they should
be on the project&#x27;s roadmap). Lastly, be sure to get a detailed
understanding the product&#x27;s ability to import/export data, as you will
surely need to work with legacy data at some point. Data portability
also enables you to switch systems or vendors, should the need arise. </p><p>EXAMPLE: The health information management system DPG <a href="https://docs.dhis2.org/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHIS2 publishes
clear documentation</a> about installation and
configuration as well as
its Web API, which enables
external systems (e.g. third-party software, web portals, and other
internal DHIS2 modules) to securely access and manipulate DHIS2 data. The DPG
MOSIP also publishes <a href="https://docs.mosip.io/platform/apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good documentation on its APIs</a>. </p><p>A lot of open-source products are available as
commercial-off-the-shelf solutions; often they are fairly
straightforward to integrate and do not require much customization.</p><p>This modules outlines <em>general</em> but essential points to consider in assessing such
solutions for adoption suitability.  </p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: What are software engineering best practices and deeper
technology choice considerations for DPGs, such as how to build for scalability?</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: To evaluate an open-source product for adoption, you
need to look at it from several different perspectives:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Functionality.</strong> Whether it has the functionality you need,
either right now or plausibly planned on a roadmap (a roadmap that
you may, in some cases, decide to influence or help accelerate).
Does it provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)?  Robust
data portability?  Is it extensible?</p></li><li><p><strong>Technical quality.</strong> This is just the technical quality of the
implementation: how well did they do what they meant to do?  Is the
software stable and reliable?  Will it scale to the number of users
you need?  Does the project follow good security practices? </p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainability.</strong> The long-term sustainability of the project: is
there just one lone developer working in her spare time, or, at the
other extreme, are there multiple companies paying developers to
collaborate on maintaining and extending the project?  (See
the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/community#community-and-ecosystem">Community</a> module
for more on this topic.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsiveness.</strong> Historically, how responsive is the project to
its users?  Do bug reports get processed in a timely fashion?  Are
contributions welcomed?  Is there a way to influence the roadmap?
When security vulnerabilities arise, does the project handle them
promptly and competently?  Are there community participation
guidelines?</p></li><li><p><strong>Support.</strong> Is there up-to-date documentation?  Are there active
user forums?  Are commercial support providers available for you to
hire, and if so, are they constructively integrated into the
project&#x27;s development community?</p></li></ol><p>The sections that follow elaborate on some of the areas above and form
a kind of checklist that you can use in evaluating an open-source
product for adoption as a DPG (or as part of a new DPG to be created).</p><p>Throughout this module we will sometimes use the word &quot;product&quot; and
sometimes use the word &quot;project&quot;.  They are closely related but
emphasize different things.  The &quot;product&quot; is what you deploy and may
also pay for: a packaged DPG, often accompanied by a support contract
or at least by the potential availability of on-demand commercial
support should you ever need it.  The &quot;project&quot;, on the other hand, is
the living software community in which developers and organizations
collaborate to produce the software that is the core of the product, along
with documentation, support, and more (depending on the project type; see
the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/community#community-and-ecosystem">Community</a> module).</p><p>Typically, the organizations that provide product-shaped offerings are
also deeply involved in the project.  As you&#x27;ll see below, that&#x27;s one
of the things to look for when evaluating both projects and vendors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="assessing-security">Assessing Security<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#assessing-security" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are no guarantees when it comes to computer and network
security.  Even the largest companies and the most careful, thorough
government agencies still get hacked from time to time.  Adding a new
software system to your existing portfolio only increases risk -- to
use the language of computer security, you&#x27;ve expanded your &quot;attack
surface&quot;.</p><p>However, at the point when you are still evaluating a product, there
are some steps you can take to lower that risk.  For the most part,
those steps do <em>not</em> involve actually evaluating the code itself --
that would be a highly demanding technical task, and most procurement
evaluation efforts do not have the capacity to undertake it.  Instead,
you look for certain external signs that indicate whether the project
has its security house reasonably well in order.  For the most part,
these are evaluations of &quot;project&quot; more than of &quot;product&quot;, but we will note
where
that distinction is important.</p><ul><li><p>Does the project have a documented and secure way to receive
external reports about security vulnerabilities?</p><p>If you are working with a vendor that has a relationship with the
project, then that vendor will know the answer to this.  The project
should document a method by which anyone can report a security
vulnerability in such a way that that report does not become public
until after the vulnerability is fixed and a new release of the
product has been made.  (This means that such reports are not
normal, publicly-posted bug tickets -- a rare exception to the rule
that information in an open-source project is all publicly visible.)</p><p>A good example of a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Bugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clearly documented security vulnerability reportin process
is from the Fedora
Project</a>, whose Fedora
Linux is part of the DPG Resources collection.  The DHIS2 DPG also
publishes a <a href="https://dhis2.org/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear process for reporting
security vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Look at the project&#x27;s web site or
documentation to see what it says about reporting security
vulnerabilities. If applicable, ask the vendor.</p></li><li><p>Does the project have a way to make security patch releases?  And
has it done so?</p><p>A security patch release is a new version of the product that
differs from a previous version only by the inclusion of a security
fix.  If a project has a history of putting out such releases, that
increases the likelihood that the project is handling security
vulnerabilities competently in general.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Look at the project&#x27;s release history and
see if there are any security patch releases, which would indicate
that the project is handling security vulnerabilities at least at a
base level of competency.</p></li><li><p>Does the project acquire CVE numbers for security problems?</p><p>A &quot;Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures&quot; (CVE) number is a globally
recognized unique identifier for a specific vulnerability in a
specific piece of software.</p><p>A CVE number looks something like &quot;CVE-2021-0160,&quot; where the first
numeric part is the year, and the second is an increasing sequence
number (it may exceed four digits if more than 10,000 numbers are
handed out in a given year).  The CVE list is maintained at
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cve.mitre.org</a>.  Its purpose is to a provide
standardized name for every known computer security problem, so that
everyone has a single, canonical name to use when discussing that
problem and a central place to go to find out more information.</p><p><strong>FURTHER READING</strong>: For a more detailed explanation of how CVE numbers are acquired,
used, and evaluated, see
<a href="https://producingoss.com/en/publicity.html#security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Producing Open Source</a>.<br>
<!-- -->For a particularly clear exposition of how one
large open-source project uses CVE numbers, see the <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/cve-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debian GNU/Linux project&#x27;s description</a>.</p></li></ul><p>  This may sound surprising, but if a project has a history of
obtaining CVE numbers for vulnerabilities, for example as the DPG
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-45/product_id-42731/Apache-Fineract.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Fineract does</a>,
that&#x27;s actually a <em>good</em> sign: it means the project is integrated
into the wider community of global computer security response and
is following the standard procedures.</p><p>  Note that a project having many CVE numbers associated with it
does not necessarily signify inattention to security problems.
Often it signifies the opposite: that the project takes security
very seriously and therefore obtains CVE numbers even for small,
trivial security problems that don&#x27;t really put user data at risk.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/find/search_tips.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search the CVE
list</a> to see how
well-represented the product you&#x27;re considering is in the CVE
database.</p><p>  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla&#x27;s security web
site</a> is another example of
how a commercial company that fosters numerous open-source projects
communicates around security issues.</p><ul><li><p>Are the project&#x27;s dependencies up-to-date?</p><p>This does require some mild technical evaluation of the project
itself, not of the raw source code but of the third-party
dependencies the project relies on.  If you have the technical
capacity to browse the dependency (for the latest version of the
project) and see how up-to-date those dependencies are, that can shed
some light on how highly the project prioritizes security concerns.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Confirm that third-party dependencies are updated. </p></li><li><p>Has the project had a professional security audit performed?</p><p>It&#x27;s not common for open-source projects to have professional
security audits conducted, because such audits are expensive.
However, it happens sometimes, and when it does happen that&#x27;s a very
good sign.  The results of the audit, which review security issues
at a particular point in time, should be publicly available from the
project&#x27;s home site (after any important issues found by the audit
have been fixed and released, of course). </p><p>If you are seriously considering using a product for especially
sensitive data, then you might commission a security audit if you
have the resources to do so and offer to make the results available
to the project.  You would send those results in however the project
requests; typically, that would just be via their normal security
reporting channels.  </p><p>If the product has been implemented broadly, you might find public
audit documentation that&#x27;s specific to individual
implementations. These are likely to cover processes and policies,
such as adherence to national regulation, as well as the software
itself, but they&#x27;re still useful resources. For example, the National Audit
Office of Estonia <a href="https://eurosai-it.org/news/newsletter/1-2021/updates-from-itwg-members/estonia-x-road-and-audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently audited
X-Road</a>
and found that implementing agencies weren&#x27;t adhering to some of the
security policies we recommend in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/policy#policy">Policy</a> module.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: See if any security audits are publicly available.  </p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="stability-and-reliability">Stability and Reliability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#stability-and-reliability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You can make a reasonably accurate estimate a product&#x27;s stability and
reliability by looking at three things:</p><p>1) &quot;The word on the street&quot; -- that is, look at what people who
already use that product are saying about it on the Internet.</p><p>2) The software&#x27;s own bug report database.</p><p>3) The existence of vendors who offer commercial support for the
software.</p><p>Taking them in order:</p><p>Regarding (1): Software fortunately does not suffer very much from
the &quot;fake reviews&quot; problem found on non-technical retail/consumer
review sites (e.g., Yelp, Amazon, etc).  Most of what you see will
honestly reflect people&#x27;s actual experience.  Therefore, your job is just to
find the places where people whose needs and capabilities are similar
to yours are posting their comments.  Standard web search engines will
get you pretty far and may be all you need.  You can also search
directly in sites that focus on the system administrator audience. The
best known of these is probably <a href="https://serverfault.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server
Fault</a>.</p><p>Regarding (2): If someone with even a little bit of technical
knowledge spends about half an hour wandering through a project&#x27;s bug
report database, they can very quickly get an idea of whether the
project suffers from stability and reliability problem.  Sort by date
and focus on recent reports (e.g., from within the last one or two
release cycles). It doesn&#x27;t matter if the project formerly had
stability issues, as long as they&#x27;re fixed now, and anyway many
projects have such issues when they were first getting started.
(Remember that the number of tickets present in a project&#x27;s bug tracker
is proportional to the number of users the project has, not to the
number of actual defects in the software.)</p><p>Regarding (3): The existence of commercial support offerings is a
<em>very</em> good sign -- in general, really, but especially for the
stability and reliability of the project.  Commercial support vendors
have a very strong interest in the software&#x27;s stability: unstable
software costs them money because it requires their staff to do more
interrupt-driven work.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: The existence of multiple, diverse
vendors providing commercial
support is practically a guarantee that the product is as stable and
reliable as possible, while looking through public reviews and the
bug report database will give you additional insight into a product&#x27;s
stability and reliability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="scalability-and-deployment-investment">Scalability and Deployment Investment<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#scalability-and-deployment-investment" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>An important part of evaluating a DPG is to evaluate the investment
your team must make to deploy the DPG <em>in a way that meets your
requirements</em>.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: As a general rule, the more scalability you
need, the more up-front investment you must make in configuring your
deployment.</p><p>For example, many systems typically come with a default
(&quot;out-of-the-box&quot;) configuration in which all parts of the system are
installed on one server machine, because that way is simplest to
maintain.  But if your intended usage needs to scale to millions of
users (or to <a href="https://media.un.org/en/asset/k17/k17a9bg6o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.25 billion
citizens</a>, as is the
case with India&#x27;s open-source digital ID solution), or to millions of
some other kind of data item, then you will likely need a more complex
configuration, with the database portion of the software running on
many separate servers, various kinds of monitoring and
automated health checks in place, etc.  Such configurations are often
documented and well-supported by the project too, they just aren&#x27;t
what the project offers as the default option, because many deployers
don&#x27;t need that kind of scale, and of course the project wants the
majority of deployers to have the easiest possible out-of-the-box
experience.</p><p>Thus, start by understanding your own parameters: how much investment,
in terms of time and money, are you willing to make to support a given
scale of usage?</p><p>If you are working with a vendor, they can help guide you through
those calculations.  If you are not working with a vendor, the
project&#x27;s designated user support forums are often a very good
place to get rough estimates of the scale/investment ratio from people
who already have experience deploying it.  Make good use of those
forums: search the archives for others who have asked scalability and
deployment questions, and if you don&#x27;t see the answers you need, then
post questions yourself.  That&#x27;s what the forums are there for, and
when you post a well-thought-out question you are actually doing the
project a favor: if someone answers it, your question and their answer
will be in the public archives for others to find in future searches.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="data-portability-importexport-and-interoperability">Data Portability (Import/Export and Interoperability)<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#data-portability-importexport-and-interoperability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Data portability is the ability to import data into and export data
out of a system, ideally to/from standard formats that are supported
by other commonly-used software systems.</p><p>Sadly, data portability -- especially export capability -- is often
under-evaluated or even largely omitted from evaluations.  This may be
because it is hard to imagine, when you are considering moving <em>to</em> a
new system, that one day in the future you may be moving away from it.
But for DPGs in particular, data portability is one of the most
important concerns.  There is often some legacy data, somewhere, that
you will want to import into the system, even if you don&#x27;t know at the
time of the evaluation and procurement that that legacy data exists.
And there are many reasons why you might be interested in exporting
data even if you are not migrating away from the system to something
else (see the below section <a href="#programmatic-control-apis">Programmatic
Control</a> for more about these).
Moreover, open projects must ensure they <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support extraction or
importation of non-PII data in a non-proprietary
format</a> in order to qualify
as a formal DPG (which circles back to the importance of <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open
standards</a>, another
essential part to the definition of a DPG).</p><p>Data portability is one area where vendors sometimes give unreliable
information or at least may quietly leave out certain exceptions and
caveats.  If you ask a vendor questions about
import/export capabilities, be sure to make those questions as specific and precise
as possible.  For example, don&#x27;t simply ask &quot;Can the system export its data?&quot;
The answer will almost always be &quot;Yes!&quot;  Instead, ask something like
&quot;Can the system export all of its data in standard format FOO such
that it can be imported by Some Competing Program without any
information being lost or miscategorized?&quot;, where &quot;FOO&quot; is the name of
some actual format, and you&#x27;ve identified the particular competing
program.  Then you&#x27;ll likely get a more nuanced and complicated
answer, because import and export functionality tend not to be a
binary, yes-or-no propositions.  More often, there is an import/export
feature but the real question is how much pre- or post-action data
manipulation is required to get the end result that you need.</p><p>Even if you have vendor support, you should also search the
Internet and the project&#x27;s forums for reports from others about
importing and exporting the data formats that matter for you.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="data-portability-and-avoiding-vendor-lock-in">Data Portability and Avoiding Vendor Lock-In<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#data-portability-and-avoiding-vendor-lock-in" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Remember that import/export functionality can be important to your
ability to switch <em>vendors</em>, not just to switch systems.  If you want
to continue using the same DPG but change your support contract from
one vendor to another, it is not always the case that the two vendors
will be able to perform a smooth hand-off.  Instead, the new vendor
will often want to deploy their own copy of the system, using a
deployment configuration that they are accustomed to, and move your
data from the old system to the new system.  In order to better enforce this point
about data portability, agencies could consider adding a
contractural clause that a vendor is required to put in additional hours above
a certain baseline to port data to a new vendor implementation,
should the need to switch vendor support arise at some future point. </p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Be sure to get a detailed understanding the
product&#x27;s ability to import/export data. Even if you have a vendor
supporting you, search the Internet and the project&#x27;s forums for
reports from others about importing and exporting the data formats
that matter to you. This will help you plan for needed resources and
project scheduling as well as be better prepared should you need to
switch vendor support at some point.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="programmatic-control-apis">Programmatic Control (APIs)<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#programmatic-control-apis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Interacting with a system programmatically means other programs
issuing commands to the system and being able to read/send data
from/to it.</p><p>It is unfortunate that such a key concept is hidden behind the
technical acronym &#x27;API.&#x27;  If you aren&#x27;t already familiar with what
APIs do, please take a moment to read the Introduction to APIs for
Non-Technical Readers section in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-apis#appendix-introduction-to-apis-for-non-technical-readers">Appendix: APIs</a> as well as the example of Open Referral in the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/appendix-examples#appendix-examples">Appendix: Examples</a>, then come back here.</p><p>Having a documented API as part of a service is very important.  APIs
make many things possible. The read-only side of an API enables
sophisticated analytics, reports, and notifications, for example.  The
read-write side opens up the possibility of interacting with the
system&#x27;s data in ways beyond what the regular user interface allows.
If the data in the system matters at all, eventually someone will want
to work with that data in a programmatic way, and the only way to do
that effectively at scale -- meaning scale for volume or for
application to new areas -- is through an API.</p><p>APIs from Fineract and Mifos X enabled those financial
inclusion DPGs to scale to support numerous use cases -- from
traditional banks to digital-first neo banks and wallet/payment
providers -- from over 400 institutions in 40 countries.  In another example, the
non-profit Population Services International (PSI) learned that many
health ministries and other non-profits were using the DPG DHIS2 with
Microsoft PowerBI for data visualizations, but the process for moving
data from DHIS2 into the popular PowerBI product was
cumbersome. DHIS2&#x27;s well documented API enabled PSI to partner with
BAO Systems to create <a href="https://community.dhis2.org/t/dhis2-to-powerbi-connector-is-ready-check-out-the-video-test-it-use-it-and-give-us-feedback/37043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmatic connectivity to Microsoft
PowerBI</a>. The
DPG <a href="https://www.avyantra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avyantra</a> uses machine learning to
improve diagnoses of infants affected by neonatal sepsis. Their
application&#x27;s modular approach and use of [APIs make it more easily
<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/avyantra-health-technologies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extendable</a> to diagnosing other critical medical conditions in
neonates, infants, and
children. Similarly, API availability for the
DPG DHIS2 is helping its expansion into <a href="https://dhis2.org/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new sectors like education and
logistics</a>.</p><p>In some cases, the API could be as simple as an &quot;export&quot; button,
causing a spreadsheet to be downloaded (usually in CSV --
&quot;comma-separated value&quot; -- format, a kind of baseline import/export
format supported by all spreadsheet programs).  But often a more
sophisticated API would be better.  For example, there may be queries
or interrelations that are specific to the particular kind of data in
question, and those queries might not be provided by most spreadsheet
programs.  A tailored API that is aware of such specificities can
provide query functionality to support them.  Also, sometimes there&#x27;s
just a <em>lot</em> of data, so much that it would be too slow to download it
all in a CSV file. An API allows people to target the exact subset
of the data they need and download only that.</p><p>Fortunately, when systems have an API, it is usually prominently
documented and mentioned in the product&#x27;s feature list.  Check that
documentation and search for examples on the Internet of people using
that API to accomplish real-world tasks.</p><p>Even when a system does not have a published API, it&#x27;s often the case
that there is already an internal, unofficial API and the project
is simply waiting until it settles down a bit before publishing it.
The project roadmap or user forums may say more about this; also, as
usual, an experienced vendor can point you to more information.</p><p>If a product works with data at any scale but has no API and no
intention of developing an API, that is usually a bad sign.  Unless
there is some reasonable explanation for the omission, the lack of an
API should be considered a serious point against enterprise-wide
adoption of the system.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Ensure the availability of documented Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are very important to supporting a full
range of the functionality
you&#x27;ll likely need. Check documentation and search for examples on the
Internet of people using that API to accomplish real-world tasks. Lack
of published APIs isn&#x27;t uncommon for early stage open-source products,
but this situation (or lack of a roadmap) is unacceptable for products
intended to work with data at scale.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="extensibility">Extensibility<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#extensibility" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Software system extensibility can come under many different names:
&quot;plugins&quot;, &quot;add-ons&quot;, &quot;add-ins&quot;, and &quot;extensions&quot; or &quot;extension
modules&quot; are the most common, though sometimes &quot;components&quot; is
(confusingly) used too.</p><p>All of these things refer to the same basic idea: the ability to
extend the system&#x27;s functionality by adding new code from the outside
in certain well-defined ways (see the <a href="#programmatic-control-apis">Programmatic
Control</a> section above).  Sometimes a system is even extensible in
more than one programming language, though often there is a primary
supported language that most users prefer and that is supported
best. A system based on a modular architecture, with loosely coupled software components, is one
that&#x27;s more easily extensible.</p><p>Some well-known and widely-used open-source systems owe much of their
success and growth to being easily extensible in this fashion, such as:
<a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a>,
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drupal</a>,
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Django</a>,
<a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MediaWiki</a>,
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>, and
<a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromium</a>.  Extensibility has a long
history and is not confined to open-source software, however.
AutoCAD, a system for computer-aided drafting, has had an extension
language since the mid-1980s, and Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio
development environment has a rich extension community primarily
writing extensions in the Visual Basic programming language.</p><p>Extensibility tends to be a sign of maturity.  Products usually become
extensible after acquiring an initial user base and in response to the
varied demands of that user base.  Instead of incorporating every user
request as a core feature (which would lead to a disorganized and
unmaintainable core), the project keeps the baseline system relatively
simple, and instead encourages a parallel community of extensions to
be developed on top of that baseline -- often developed by users or by
organizations supporting groups of users.</p><p>When evaluating a system, discovering that it is extensible at all is
already a positive sign.  The next thing to look at is the richness of
that extensibility.  How powerful is the extension language, how many
extensions already exist, and how useful are they?</p><p>One quick way to answer these questions is to look for a listing of
extensions.  For example, WordPress has the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress
Plugins</a> marketplace, Firefox has
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Add-ons</a>, etc.  Look in
the listing for a diversity of third parties offering extensions,
especially for commercial vendors involved in that ecosystem.</p><p>The most promising sign of all is when you see multiple different
extensions being offered that all do roughly the same thing.  That
signifies a truly active and competitive extension community, which in
turn implies good things about the software system on which the
extensions are based.</p><p>When you are evaluating vendors for an extensible system, you should
prefer vendors that have demonstrated experience writing extensions,
especially vendors who are well-represented in the public marketplace
of extensions that may be used with the system (if any exist).</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: An open-source product&#x27;s extensibility is
often a sign of maturity, as it&#x27;s developed enough to have a stable
foundation and pushes flexibility through extensions that can change
more often to meet more specific, and varied, user needs. When you are
evaluating vendors for an extensible system, look for vendors that
have demonstrated experience writing extensions.</p><p>(As a side note, the peak of extensibility is when extensions are where most new
functionality is created.  Veteran software architect Jim Blandy
writes, in the book &quot;Beautiful Architecture&quot; (O&#x27;Reilly Media, 2009),
that &quot;<!-- -->[there is a]<!-- --> question we can ask of any extension language we
encounter: is the extension language the preferred way to implement
most new features for the application?&quot;  When an application &quot;places
its extension language at the heart of its architecture, <!-- -->[that is]<!-- --> a
strong argument that the language&#x27;s relationship with the application
has been designed properly.&quot;)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="documentation">Documentation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#documentation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most open-source software systems come with at least some
documentation -- that is, documentation that is officially maintained
by the project itself and published together with the software.  Such
documentation is actually a <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPG
requirement</a>; see the DPG
<a href="https://docs.mosip.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOSIP</a>
for a good example of such documentation. In many cases, there is also a
wealth of scattered and heterogeneous third-party documentation:
&quot;HOWTO&quot; blog posts, answers posted on sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack
Overflow</a>, etc.</p><p>The best way to evaluate all this documentation is through a limited
set of shallow, task-oriented queries.  Reading it all would be too
time-consuming and pointless, because much of the documentation may
be about features you will never use.  Instead, pick a few questions
that you can guess are likely to come up and see how quickly you can
find areas of documentation -- in both the official documentation and
in unofficial sources -- that address those questions.</p><p>There is one particular task-oriented inquiry that you should almost
always make: look at the documentation for the system&#x27;s installation
and initial configuration.  Whatever else you may or may not do with
the system, the first step is always that you (or your supporting
vendor) are going to deploy it.  The project knows that&#x27;s true for
everyone, so if there&#x27;s one part of the documentation that should be
in at least decent shape, it&#x27;s that.  If the deployment documentation
is missing or is obviously incomplete, that is a warning sign about
the entire product.</p><p>When working with vendors, beware of those who try to steer you to
their proprietary documentation for functionality that is part of the
public product.  Responsible vendors who are maintaining a healthy
relationship with the project&#x27;s development community will generally
focus on improving the project&#x27;s documentation rather than maintaining
a separate, non-open-source set of documentation that&#x27;s just for their
customers.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Look at the product&#x27;s installation and
initial configuration documentation.  If this deployment documentation
is missing or is obviously incomplete, that is a warning sign about
the entire product. When working with vendors, beware of those who try
to steer you to their proprietary documentation for functionality that
is part of the public product.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="commercial-support-availability">Commercial Support Availability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#commercial-support-availability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The existence of commercial support offerings for a system, ideally
from multiple vendors, is something to look for in an evaluation.  The
presence of commercial support means that someone else -- that vendor
-- has <em>already</em> done an evaluation of the system and found it
sufficiently useful and stable to invest money in training staff and
creating a support offering.</p><p>Assuming you find vendors, then, how should you evaluate them?</p><p>One key thing to look for is the vendor&#x27;s presence in the project&#x27;s
development and support communities.  Does the vendor have staff
taking active part in the development of the software?  Does the
vendor have staff both filing and responding to bug reports?  Are they
active in the discussion forums, both development-oriented and
user-oriented?</p><p>You don&#x27;t need to do the detective work from scratch.  You can save
yourself a lot of time by asking the vendor about their role in the
project community, specifically asking them for evidence (e.g.,
the names of the staff and where to look for them).  Then you can
easily spot-check the claims yourself by searching in the project&#x27;s
public resources, primarily the code repository, the bug tracker, and
the discussion/support forums.</p><p>If the project has a vendor listing page (see, for example, the DPG
<a href="https://mojaloop.io/business-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mojaloop&#x27;s business
directory</a>), the vendor should
be on that list.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>: If possible, work with vendors that can show solid, public
evidence of their contributions to the project.  Again, it&#x27;s a good sign if an
open-source product
has commercial support around it, such as consulting and development
companies. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="non-commercial-support-availability">Non-Commercial Support Availability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#non-commercial-support-availability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Open-source projects often have quite responsive user support forums --
places where anyone who has deployed or who uses the software can ask
a question and get answers from experienced users (for example, see
the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/lists.html#http-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache HTTP Server user
forum</a>). The people
who are subscribed to these forums are there for a variety of reasons.
Sometimes they are there because they make heavy use of the software
and want to gain as much information as they can from other users (but
therefore are also available to respond to questions from newcomers).
Sometimes they are there because they represent a vendor, either
overtly or discreetly, and are helping to maintain the vendor&#x27;s presence
in the community.  In general, as long as your postings adhere to the
forum&#x27;s stated guidelines, they will be welcomed.  If you ask a
question and no one knows the answer, you may get silence in response,
but even then posting is usually still worthwhile in the long run: a
response may come much later from someone who is deploying the
software in a setup similar to yours, and once you have found each
other via the forum, you&#x27;ll be able to provide mutual support
from then on (hopefully still using the public forum!).</p><p>The quality of non-commercial support can vary over time.  Some
projects have a healthy, enduring culture and process to consistently
maintain support.  Other projects overly depend on one or several
individuals who take support upon themselves.  In assessing a
project&#x27;s ability to provide open-source support, it can be useful to
see who and how many people are providing that support over what time
period.  The strongest signal of high-level support will be when help
is provided in general by a community and there is a culture of
reinforcing that community activity.  At the other end of the
spectrum, one will find a project&#x27;s lead developer heroically also
playing the support role.  That can work, but is sometimes an
indication that the project overly depends on one person who might
move on or burn out.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: User support forums are useful resources in
your evaluation (just as open user support forums will be important to others
evaluating your DPG). Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask questions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="influence-and-participation">Influence and Participation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#influence-and-participation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Procuring a DPG is very different from buying a physical good like a
truck or a desk.  You do not, realistically, have much opportunity to
influence the truck manufacturer, nor collaborate with them to improve
the trucks that will be coming to the market next year.  But with
DPGs, that possibility very much exists, and this should be taken into
account when evaluating both a particular DPG and your own current
capacity for taking advantage of that opportunity (for more on the
latter point, see the note about possible future work on assessing internal
capacity below).</p><p>The evaluative question being asked here is: &quot;What
routes does the project have for us to convert our own usage, and
potentially some financial support, into useful inputs for the
sustainability and direction of the project, thus gaining increased return on our
own investment in choosing the product in the first place?&quot;</p><p>When you are first evaluating a DPG for initial deployment, this kind
of long-term investment analysis is usually premature.  It is more
appropriate to undertake it after you have already been using the DPG
for some period of time and have some confidence that deeper
investment is likely to pay off for your organization.</p><p>Most often, routes for influence go through vendors.  Commercial
vendors are often the organizations that have the greatest motivation
to maintain a long-term contributor relationship with the project and the
experience in the project&#x27;s technical culture to know
what goals can be accomplished in what periods of time.  This is why
evaluating the vendor&#x27;s relationship with the project (as discussed above in
<a href="#commercial-support-availability">Commercial Support Availability</a> as well as in
the
<a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/community#community">Community</a> module) is so important: the vendor can influence the project on
your behalf.</p><p>It&#x27;s also important to evaluate the project to make sure it has routes
of influence available.  You can do this indirectly, by asking your
vendor(s) to show where their past attempts to influence have been
successful and how.  You can also do it directly, with a little more
effort, by looking at the project&#x27;s governance and the discussions
that lead to new features and roadmap decisions.  Although any form of
open-source project governance can, in principle, be amenable to
influence, in practice projects that are run by committee are more
reliably amenable to influence, because you have the possibility of
being on that committee -- or, rather, of being represented on the
committee by an existing member.  Recall too that open-source projects
later in their lifecycle are often less open to influence, as they
will generally prioritize stability.  This is usually true for modular
projects as well, although their exensibility does give you a path for
influence (see the <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/community#community">Community</a> module).</p><p>Project governance documents
are useful insofar as they describe the formal structure of how
decisions are made.  However, the way decisions are made in practice
can sometimes diverge from this official method: as long as everyone
in the project is happy, there is no reason for anyone to cite the
rule book -- thus gradual drift from the rules can happen.  As a
newcomer evaluating the project, therefore, if you look only at the
rule book you will only get part of the picture.  You have to also
look at some of the conversations in the development forums and see
how decisions are made in practice.  This knowledge, combined with
input from your technical staff (if available) and vendors (if
available) will allow you to make rough guesses about the possibility
and usefulness of having long-term influence in the project and about
what sort of commitment of resources that influence might require.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Open-source projects have lifecycles, and the
maturity level of a project will generally dictate your ability to
influence and level/type of investment needed.</p><p>If your own staff has the technical expertise to participate directly
in the DPG&#x27;s development community, that is an investment that may be
worth considering.  It usually starts with fixing bugs, first small
ones and then larger ones, and eventually may progress to proposing
and adding new features.  The reason for this gradual progression is
twofold: first, it takes time for the staff to learn the software&#x27;s
internals, of course.  Second, it takes time for the staff to gain the
credibility and standing in the project needed for successfully
getting large feature improvements landed in the core code.</p><p>Because of the gradual nature of this progression, think carefully
about your ability to make and hold to a long-term commitment as staff
begin to deepen their investment.  A few easy, small-scale bug fixes
does not require great investment, but for staff to get much more
involved than that will generally consistent managerial support.  In
some cases that may be a worthwhile investment, but in other cases it
might not be the best use of staff time from your organization&#x27;s
perspective.</p><p>(Note that staff can always be encouraged to participate in user
support forums, regardless of whether they are participating in any
technical way.  Presence in those forums is a good way to stay in
touch with the project&#x27;s currents and to develop expertise that can be
very useful to have in-house, even if you also have a support vendor.)</p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: We were thinking of having a section &quot;Internal
Capacity Assessment&quot; here.  To produce it, one could start by
collecting relevant points from all the other sections, then examine
what specific internal capacities would be needed to take advantage of
or implement the advice given in those points.  It should be limited
to outlining what&#x27;s most important and what&#x27;s most often overlooked in
thinking about internal capacity, for DPGs specifically, and ideally
come from talking through the toolkit with government agencies and
others involved with DPGs; otherwise the topic could be too large and
too general for this toolkit.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="ecosystem-mapping-for-adoptability">Ecosystem Mapping for Adoptability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#ecosystem-mapping-for-adoptability" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The adoptability of a DPG depends on the the overall landscape of
users, deployers, and technical investors in which that DPG is
situated.  In the sections above, we have discussed some elements of
this landscape a bit already: sources of commercial and non-commercial
support, the possibility of technical involvement from your in-house
IT staff or from a vendor contracted for the purpose, etc.  However,
it&#x27;s also useful to look at that landscape as a whole -- as an
ecosystem of stakeholders and, where applicable, relationships between
them.</p><p>When you&#x27;re about to make an investment in a DPG, such as by deploying
it for sustained use, it can be very helpful to take a step back and
explicitly map out that ecosystem, in a quick, lightweight exercise. (This exercise
is equally useful in planning to create a new DPG.)</p><p>Making such a map can reveal both gaps and opportunities.  For
example, an ecosystem map might reveal a gap by showing that the main
sources of commercial support are effectively serving one large
primary customer -- meaning that your needs might take second place to
that customer&#x27;s needs, so you might want to try to stimulate a new
company to make its own support offering.  Or an ecosystem map might
reveal an opportunity by showing that there is another public agency
already using the DPG and who that agency&#x27;s sources of support are.</p><p>There are many ways to produce an ecosystem map, and you should not
worry too much about procedure or completeness.  It&#x27;s better to do it
quickly and easily, so that you don&#x27;t delay the exercise.  Take what&#x27;s
immediately visible to you in the DPG&#x27;s discussion forums, bug
tracker, and other easily accessible online sources.  If you know
someone who&#x27;s involved in the project in some way, call them up and
ask them some questions about who else is using the DPG, where sources
of support are, and anything else they might know.  You&#x27;re looking for
information about deployers, contributors, service and support
providers, integrators, and competing or adjacent efforts.</p><p>Then draw a map of what you&#x27;ve found out, doing it as a group exercise
if possible so that you draw on everyone&#x27;s knowledge.  The drawing
should be messy and quick -- a year from now it will probably be out
of date, and that&#x27;s okay.  Just hand-draw it on paper or on a
whiteboard.</p><p>Here is a map drawn to identify stakeholders in the <a href="https://archesproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arches
Project</a>. The original was hand-drawn,
but we cleaned up a bit for publication:</p><p><img alt="Ecosystem map for the Arches Project (https://archesproject.org/)." src="/publicgoods-toolkit/assets/images/example-ecosystem-map-768x550-cb63f7204c0d9c4afba99a083ebe2c18.png"></p><p>Because we were interested in uncovering information about geographic
distribution of support sources, this map includes regional groupings
that might not be necessary on your map.  Conversely, your map might
show relationships (e.g., contractual relationships) between certain
stakeholders that we did not bother to show here.  This map did not
focus on relationships because its purpose was to help us understand
where the project was succeeding geographically and how to support
participants spreading the project into new communities.  But if
you&#x27;re drawing a map to help assess a DPG&#x27;s adoptability, you should
include the elements and relationships that matter most for your
circumstances.</p><p>While there is no one right way to draw an ecosystem map, there are
some pitfalls to watch out for -- signs that the map might be missing
important information:</p><ul><li><p>If the map looks like a star, with all the connections radiating out
of one central entity, then the map is probably not capturing the
true complexity and topology of relationships.</p></li><li><p>If it is more of a cloud than a map, then it might not be grouping
entities in useful ways, e.g., it might be failing to separate them
by the function they perform in the ecosystem</p></li><li><p>If the map tries to answer too many questions at once, it will be
incomprehensible.  It&#x27;s better to focus on a few interrelated
questions, such as who the deployers and support providers are and
what the relationships are between them.</p></li></ul><p>Once you have the map in front of you, factors relevant to
adoptability that might not have been apparent before can suddenly
become obvious.  For example, you might notice that every other known
deployer has deep in-house IT capability.  If your organization does
not have that kind of in-house IT capacity, that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily
mean that you shouldn&#x27;t use the DPG, but it would at least indicate
that a closer look at the deployment requirements may be in order.</p><p>Ecosystem mapping can reveal gaps in the landscape. For example,
&quot;rocket ship&quot; projects often struggle to provide user support.  If
such support is important and the ecosystem does not provide it, you
will have to find anther way to fill this gap.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: A simple ecosystem map can help you think through other
adoptability factors that might be relevant.  What in the ecosystem actors, their
types, and their distribution gives you additional insight? For the project&#x27;s likely
archetype, what would you expect to see in that ecosystem? Are there problematic
gaps or useful opportunties? </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="evaluation-checklist">Evaluation Checklist<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#evaluation-checklist" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This section summarizes the previous considerations around adoptability in a

and are they well documented? Can you find examples of these APIs being used in
ways similar to your plans?</li><li>Will your data be portable? <ul><li>Can you extract or import non-PII data in a non-proprietary format? (a
requirement of the DPG standard!)</li><li>Can you import and export data in the formats you expect to need? </li><li>Can you generally import and export data with an acceptable level of pre-
and post- action cleaning and manipulation? </li></ul></li><li>Is the product extensible? <ul><li>Do many extensions exist, and are they being used? </li><li>If you are evaluating vendors to help you with an extensible product, has
the vendor created successful extensions? </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Does the product meet your requirements for technical quality?</strong> </p><ul><li>Is the product as secure as possible? <ul><li>Is there a documented process for reporting security vulnerabilities?</li><li>Are there published security patch releases? Is there a published process
for publishing these patches? </li><li>Are any third-party dependencies updated? </li><li>Does the project publish Common Vulnerability Exposure number(s)? (usually
most relevant for more mature projects) </li><li>Does the project publish security audits? (usually most relevant for more
mature projects) </li></ul></li><li>Is the product stable and reliable? <ul><li>What’s your analysis based on bug reports? </li><li>What&#x27;s your analysis of public conversations around the product? </li><li>Do commercial vendors offer services around the product? </li></ul></li><li>Is the product scalable enough? <ul><li>First, do you understand the scale you’ll require from the product? </li><li>Does the default product configuration meet your needs? </li><li>If not, is there an indication -- through formal documentation, product
reviews, conversations in user forums, etc. -- that the product can scale to
your needs?</li><li>Can you invest appropriately to deploy and support the DPG to meet your
scalability requirements? </li><li>Again, do Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) exist and are they
well documented? Can you find public examples of the product’s APIs being
used for the level of scale you’ll need? </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Does the project seem to be sustainable?</strong> </p><ul><li>Are there diverse, resource-committing participants?</li><li>Based on a rough idea of the project&#x27;s archetype, do you see the predicted types
of participants?  </li><li>Are there commercial participants? </li><li>What are the gaps and opportunities you see based on a project ecosystem map?<br>How might these impact sustainability?<br></li></ul><p><strong>Does the project seem responsive to user needs?</strong></p><ul><li>Are bug reports generally processed in a timely fashion? (note that not all
bugs can be fixed quickly, but the bug reporting system should still give you
a good indication of attention)</li><li>Are contributions welcomed? </li><li>Are there ways for participants to influence the roadmap? </li><li>When security vulnerabilities arise, does the project handle them promptly and
competently? </li><li>Are there community participation guidelines, and are they enforced?</li></ul><p><strong>Will the project provide the level of support you require?</strong></p><ul><li>Is the documentation around system installation and initial configuration of
high quality?</li><li>Overall, is documentation clear and updated? </li><li>Are there commercial support providers around the product?</li><li>If so, are they engaged in the project&#x27;s development community?</li><li>Are there active user forums? (e.g. non-commercial support)</li></ul><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: More in-depth evaluation templates might be useful to create
in the future as
this toolkit is further tested and revised. The first suggestion is
a scoring and ranking template to help agencies use the points outlined in this
section to more deeply assess open source products for adoption as a standalone
DPG or as components in a new DPG. The second is an internal capacity assessment
template aimed at
helping agencies evaluate their ability to leverage the toolkit’s broader set of
recommendations. These potential templates would be separate but equally important
tools for decision making and planning.  Such templates should start simply, but
we can imagine that different weighting prioritizations might eventually develop
depending on the application area, the desired social impact, or whether an agency
is adopting a product generally “as is” or using it as a component. For example,
an agency might place greater value on the implementation experience of a
contracting vendor with a specific open source product if that product will be
adopted wholesale versus as a component in a new DPG. The latter scenario might
place more weight on the agency’s internal capacity to manage various open source
components.</p><p>Lastly, there might be value in extending these templates to evaluate the
maturity and readiness of a DPG to be implemented at the country-level, where
issues such as scalability, financial sustainability, and a conducive government
policy environment might be particularly important.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
