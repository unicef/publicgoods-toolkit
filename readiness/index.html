organizational open-source
&#x27;readiness models&#x27;
to guide capacity
development.  </p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Identify small-scale, lower-risk investments for skill-building
experiments. These can often be aimed at places where your lack of open-source investment
is
causing problems (e.g. lack of re-usability).</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Be sure to include areas
of &#x27;adjacent value&#x27; when assessing the overall value of your DPG.
These can be multipliers to your project&#x27;s valuation. </p><p>EXAMPLE: The <a href="https://geonode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoNode project</a>, initiated by the
World Bank&#x27;s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDDR), realized significant but difficult-to-quantify value through
the vibrant commercial community that grew around the project. In
time, these contributors became so active and financially committed to
the project&#x27;s continued development that <a href="https://opendri.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OpenDRI-and-GeoNode-a-Case-Study-on-Institutional-Investments-in-Open-Source.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GFDDR was able to scale back
its
investment</a>. This dynamic outcome is hard to capture in most models. </p><p>Open source is all about execution.  Reaping the benefits of open-source
investment requires completing a series of difficult steps
ranging from designing an initial strategy to building an appropriate
community to leveraging the resulting dynamics for strategic
advantage, whether that be scaling to broad adoption quickly or
orchestrating participants to focus on areas of needed innovation.  </p><p>This module presents a somewhat abstract but experientially
based view of organizational readiness for open source, including models to consider
referencing, and practical advice for how to move your team along the
path to masterful open-source execution.  The <a href="/publicgoods-toolkit/adoptability#adoptability-assessment">Adoptability</a> module delves more deeply into specific open-source capabilities you&#x27;ll
need to effectively adopt or build an open-source product.  Note that the use of
the term &#x27;team&#x27; here also includs external vendors. </p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: What have DPG creators learned about building local vendor and
labor capacity and readiness?  What are typical readiness and capacity growth
patterns for
organizations working with open data and AI models, and how might this apply to
agencies building DPGs?  </p><p>Most government teams are not yet prepared to travel this capability
path and reap those rewards at scale.  They lag in their ability to
execute, largely because they don&#x27;t have enough experience,
particularly as compared to private industry.  But governments can
learn quickly from what&#x27;s been tried and tested by others as they&#x27;ve
built organizational capacity to use open source to
its full potential.</p><p>As an agency starts to climb the learning curve, it can be helpful to
assess current abilities as a form of organizational readiness and to
describe the journey to mastery as one of gaining capability.  Practitioners often
describe this as climbing the &quot;readiness ladder&quot;.  To do
this, we might locate current capabilities in a readiness model.
These clarify where an agency is in its journey to mastery and suggest
next steps and likely results.  Often, teams use these models to
identify areas for potential growth as well as potential pitfalls.
They are most useful for those early in their open-source progress,
and this module focuses on those beginning stages. </p><p>It is useful for an agency to consider its maturity on an organization
wide basis, but creation of an open-source DPG is usually executed by
teams, and it is the capabilities of specific teams that matter most.
Therefore, this module considers individual teams as the starting
point for analysis, because even agency-wide open-source skills
training will succeed or fail mostly at the level of specific teams
working on specific projects.  However, teams obviously work within an
organization that shapes their operational environment, and at some
point the broader the organizational view matters.  When and under
what conditions this occurs is very case dependent.</p><p>There are several readiness models that go by various names.  We share
a number of them here because it is often worth considering more than
one when examining an organization or a particular team.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://mcaffer.com/2019/02/Open-source-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff McAffer&#x27;s Engagement Model</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/todogroup/ospo101/blob/main/module2/README.md#climbing-the-open-source-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TODO Group model</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/github/maturity-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub&#x27;s Maturity Model</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qalipso&#x27;s Model</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/4/what-does-an-adult-look-like-in-an-open-source-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Walli&#x27;s Maturation Toward Adulthood</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.finos.org/hubfs/FINOS/website/pages/community/Open%20Source%20Readiness%20Roadmap%20-%203.10.2018.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FinOS Open Source Ladder</a></p></li></ul><p>Of the published models, we find the first one -- written by Microsoft
Senior Director Jeff McAffer (now Senior Director at GitHub)-- is
particularly useful.  It&#x27;s simple but includes strategic components,
accounts for realistic failure modes, and understands that open-source
readiness will be unevenly distributed in any agency large enough to
have multiple teams.  We also like how it describes the phases of
capability growth almost like generalized &#x27;mental models&#x27; at an
organization or team level in a way that&#x27;s both abstract and
pragmatic.  We&#x27;ve found that stepping back every so often to reflect
using such shared language and concepts helps teams stay grounded in
the big picture, rather than focusing exclusively on the details.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Engage the team in a frank discussion about
your open-source readiness and locate the team and the organization on
McAffer&#x27;s engagement model.  What might this level mean for
opportunities for growth, and what might it mean for potential problems?
Identify three key steps the people in that discussion can take to
improve execution capabilities at the team level and keep checking in
as the team develops.</p><p>On many teams, initial open-source capabilities might be nascent.
Team members might not have had significant (or perhaps even any)
experience using open-source strategies to create value.  The team
likely works in an environment where FOSS investment is rare, and many do not
see much reason to change that.  That lack of knowledge might
translate in some quarters into hostility toward FOSS.  People will
say &quot;It can never work here&quot; even as open source slowly seeps into
more and more of the technology around them.</p><p>At this stage, open-source strategies will be difficult to execute.
Internal political risks might be high.  Policies needed to engage
open source productively might be missing.  Staff might not know how
to begin working with external open-source contributors.  Many people
might lack even a basic understanding of what it means to do open-source
work.  Efforts to work in an open-source mode suffer from an
increased risk of failure, and they might fail in ways that reinforce
the belief that open source is not worth further consideration.</p><p>Many factors might move a team past this early stage and on their way
toward tolerating open source, but movement usually comes from
external pressure, changing environments, and staff additions and
turnover.  As conditions around an agency begin to change, and the
costs and risks of refusing to engage start to rise, pressure to
engage open source will increase.</p><p>Those costs might include the pain of maintaining internal forks of
external open-source projects. Or more commonly, the risks of <em>not</em>
maintaining all those forks.  Similarly, the benefits of making minor
open-source investments start to become clear, even if only because
other teams will begin to reap those benefits and your team gains
good, internal examples to follow.</p><p>However any specific team begins to adapt, climbing the learning curve
is often an exercise in experimentation.  Most don&#x27;t think of open-source
investment in those terms.  Instead, they cast initial open-source
forays as making small concessions to necessity.  Some see
these experiments as seizing unique, non-repeatable advantages.  Most
don&#x27;t think of those small, initial projects as the future direction
of the team.  More teams should consider the possibility, though.
Sometimes, explicitly labeling such experiments as learning exercises
and skill-building allows a team to maximize the value of those
experimental investments.  It prioritizes reflective analysis and
learning.  It gives permission to fail.  Those can be useful to teams
seeking adaptability.  When considering McAffer&#x27;s model, we might
relabel his &quot;tolerance&quot; phase as &quot;experimentation&quot;.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Look for the places where your lack of
open-source investment are causing problems that can be addressed by
small-scale, low-risk experiments.  Start there, being
sure to label these experiments as skill-building exercises.  Think
about how you can engage your larger team or organization as you
develop, making the learning relevant to their own needs and goals and
bringing them along as allies.</p><p>Experiments come in many forms, but the most common first experiment
is using some outside open-source code and engaging the open-source
project.  That might involve filing bug reports, offering a
contribution, or merely participating in project mailing lists and
forums.  These are all relatively low-risk, low-investment ways to
begin connecting a team to outside FOSS projects.  If your team&#x27;s
future plans include larger-scale open-source engagement, building
skills through these kinds of small-scale experiments can be very
productive.</p><p>The experimentation phase is usually a skill-building and
knowledge-gaining phase because it exercises the skills that cause a
team to shift from merely tolerating open source to trying to harness
it.  Having those skills throughout a team provides the vision that
starts to shift attitudes at more than just an individual level.</p><p>The problem that arises, especially as multiple teams start to embrace
FOSS, is that they lack the infrastructure to succeed at it across the
entire organization.  They are missing policies, auditing, skills,
culture, and experience.  This is a pivotal, risky moment.  A large
number of teams will still be in the initial phases.  Efforts to move
internal culture toward open source will be perceived by some as a
pointless shift toward the latest buzzword.  Despite your best
attempts to share learning across the organization, experimental
skills will still be unevenly distributed internally.  Many new
open-source projects will fail, and this will convince some that all
open source is destined to fail.  The proverbial &#x27;trough of
disillusionment&#x27; will seem unbridgable.  In some agencies, some might
even sabotage open-source projects for policy or political reasons.</p><p>McAffer sees this phase as one of hype, and perhaps that&#x27;s because
it&#x27;s also when an agency embraces open source without quite being
ready to execute.  Agencies in this phase tend to engage FOSS in
shallow, unsophisticated ways simply because they don&#x27;t yet have the
experience to make better strategic use of open-source opportunities.
The way to move past this stage is not to reduce the hype (though that
might help) but rather to increase readiness.</p><p>When an agency reaches this stage, it will have multiple teams eager
to do open source and multiple teams still wary of the change.
Managers at this stage will need guidance on using FOSS as a strategic
component and managing teams with increasingly external deliverables.
Developers will need technical infrastructure, easy-to-follow
licensing policies, and permission to engage externally.  Perhaps more
importantly, they will need to develop new habits of working in the
open and sharing even early, rough versions of their work.  Beyond
just technical teams, Human Resources will need hiring and
compensation guidance as both skills and performance evaluation
criteria shift.  Building internal systems that provide all of those
pieces is how agencies gain proficiency.  Adding skills, process, and
policy is how that happens, and it requires management approval and
resources.  Agencies that fail to provide this support from fairly
high in the organization tend to level off at this level of readiness.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: If you&#x27;ve been tracking your team&#x27;s growth in
execution capabilities and bringing others along on your learning
journey, you should have a good <em>shared</em> understanding of what skills,
processes, and policies you need to execute successfully, along with
proof points of the value such investments will bring.  This will help you
present a strong recommendation to your organization&#x27;s leadership and
help you move from the Hype to Proficient stage in McAffer&#x27;s readiness
model. (Remember that
these skills can come from external vendors as well as your internal team. Both
approaches help you build a deeper talent pool).  </p><p>Another consideration for agencies climbing the readiness ladder is
that the need for skilled open-source practitioners will almost always
exceed the supply.  The demand for open-source skills is growing so
fast. The world does not have enough experienced open-source
strategists and developers to keep up.  A number of companies and
universities have decided to address this problem by centralizing much
of their open-source expertise in an Open Source Programs Office
(OSPO).  The OSPO&#x27;s job is to use that collected expertise to improve
open-source readiness and efficacy across the entire organization,
often managing common issues like license compliance, developing an
open-source culture, ensuring high quality code releases, and
advising on software tools.  The Linux Foundation provides a good
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/creating-an-open-source-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview of the role and value of
OSPOs</a>.  The
<a href="https://todogroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TODO Group</a> is collection of private industry
OSPOs that also provides open guidance and resources.</p><p>We are not aware of many agencies that have an OSPO, but governments
should consider focusing open-source readiness efforts on one agency
or department that can then help others.  In the United States, the
federal government&#x27;s General Services Administration (GSA) did this
with <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18F</a>, which, after reaching relatively
high levels of open-source capability and knowledge, developed
guidance for other agencies approaching open source.  GSA&#x27;s Code.gov
has created a
<a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toolkit</a> that
gives agencies guidance around creating and maintaining federal source
code inventories and open-source repositories.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: At the organizational level, Open Source
Program Offices can help teams work more effectively and efficiently
in open source.  As you move up the readiness ladder, consider if such
a centralized operational function would help the organization to
execute better.</p><p>A final note on understanding and communicating the value or
cost-effectiveness of open source.  Gaining a more sophisticated
understanding of this value - and having that understanding more
broadly shared across an organization and its supporters - is both a
prerequisite to and a marker of moving along these readiness
models. Moreover, organizational decision makers and funders will want
to know the cost/benefit ratio or the return on their open-source investment and
might also want to compare the approach to alternatives.</p><p>Ultimately, the value of your DPG will depend upon how well you&#x27;ve met
your goals: a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the DPG&#x27;s
positive impact on people&#x27;s lives.  How you&#x27;ll first estimate and
later actually measure this social impact is one of the first items to
define in your project -- this obviously goes hand-in-hand with goal
setting -- and the certainty of your measurements should improve with
time.</p><p>There are tools out there that can help you make some cost and benefit
determinations, but none capture the full value of an open-source approach --
especially specific to your context -- and it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll
need to modify some combination of these tools to your needs. </p><p><strong>FUTURE WORK</strong>: Can we identify a common but customizable approach to DPG valuation
that takes into account how open approaches -- for content, data, and software --
create areas of new value and models for how these could have future multiplier
effects?  </p><p>The World Bank&#x27;s <a href="https://opendri.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OpenDRI-and-GeoNode-a-Case-Study-on-Institutional-Investments-in-Open-Source.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Data for Resilience Initiative &amp; GeoNode:A Case
Study in Institutional Investments in Open
Source</a> does a good job measuring key open-source-related intangibles.  Although it&#x27;s
hard to distill the
approach taken in the paper into a formal framework, it can be
described as paying attention to areas of adjacent value.  This
approach aligns pretty naturally with thinking of an open-source
project as part of an ecosystem -- or a set of ecosystems, from contribution
through adoption -- which will likely be the case for
most DPGs that aim for broad social impact.</p><p>Looking only at the cost of writing code themselves versus the value
received from sharing costs with partners, it&#x27;s conservatively estimated that the
GeoNode project brought around a 200% return on investment (as of
2017).  But the <em>real</em> value of open-source development to the World
Bank&#x27;s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR),
the leading organization behind GeoNode, was the self-sustaining
open-source GeoNode community that emerged and the benefits that community
continues to deliver.  For example, a consortium of U.S. government
agencies quickly picked up development work on the core of GeoNode --
valued at over $1 million USD -- which permitted GFDRR to tune its
resource investments to features it specifically needed.  Companies
began providing commercial support, helping to grow further investment
in GeoNode.  A growing user base made it easier to identify and
prioritize areas for improvement.  These are several of many aspects
of GeoNode&#x27;s community and ecosystem that prove there&#x27;s greater value
in open source than what&#x27;s captured in existing valuation frameworks.</p><p>However you ultimately decide to approach valuing your DPG, start from a
holistic view of your project and map out the potential benefits
and related costs of open source, being realistic about what you can actually measure
and prioritizing what will have the most cost and/or the most benefit
per the goals of your project. Not everything is relevant. </p><p>Some valuation frameworks and tools we recommend reviewing and adapting include: </p><ul><li><p>The Digital Impact Alliance publishes a great overview of five

Impact Toolkit for ICT
Investment</a>,
that includes guidance on which might be most fitting, depending on
factors such as available resources, skills and data -- important
considerations for any organization but perhaps particularly for those
in low-resource environments.</p></li><li><p>To get much deeper into the cost assessment side of software, USAID

(with an accompanying spreadsheet) to assess cumulative development
costs through an analysis of both retrospective and ongoing costs.
Although aimed at digital health products, it fits other application
areas as well.  Perhaps most interesting to this model is its
inclusion of a method for analyzing the cost of code, called the
Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO 81).</p></li><li><p>For an example of how the World Bank measured the direct fiscal (not social)

framework</a>
to help microfinance institutions (MFIs) forecast and analyze the
benefits of adopting the DPG <a href="https://mifos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mifos</a>, the open-source
platform for microfinance. It highlights that the decision to adopt
and deploy Mifos cannot be based only on the ROI analysis, noting the
importance of understanding non-financial intangibles, like creating a
better foundation for future innovation. The framework doesn&#x27;t include
these intangibles, which can have different prioritization and value
across implementations. Despite that limitation -- and the fact that the framework is unique
to Mifos and MFIs and thus isn&#x27;t an exact model for other projects to
follow -- it&#x27;s a well reasoned approach to a broader view of benefits
(categorized as increased revenues and decreased costs specific to how
MFIs function) and costs (categorized as project expenses, like data
migration and staff time) that&#x27;s worth reviewing. It&#x27;s a thoughtfully bounded
approach that&#x27;s specific to their context and audience.  For those looking to
create a DPG with the goal of broad adoption across different locales
with slightly different contexts, it&#x27;s also worth studying how the Grameen
Foundation created this tool to help MFIs more effectively adopt their
DPG. </p></li></ul><p>Again, none of the above models quantify and incorporate the value of
the intangible benefits of open source very well, although their costs
are generally captured.</p><p><strong>KEY RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Be sure to include areas
of &#x27;adjacent value&#x27; when assessing the overall value of your DPG.
These can be multipliers to your project&#x27;s valuation. </p><p>All of the above describes a path from the very beginning toward
eventual mastery of open source.  Our discussion focused on readiness
in terms of skills and capabilities, but the truth is that doing open
source well is more of a cultural shift than anything
else. Organizations using open source fluently quickly find that the
open approach is just their default process.  That culture shift is
what lies at the top of the readiness learning curve.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/edit/main/docs-website/docs/readiness.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/publicgoods-toolkit/policy"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« <!-- -->Policy</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/publicgoods-toolkit/procurement"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Procurement<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/UNICEFinnovate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Download</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit/releases/latest/download/publicgoods-toolkit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Toolkit PDF<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Contribute</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2022 UNICEF.
