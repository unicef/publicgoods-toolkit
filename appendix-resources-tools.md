# Appendix: Resources and Tools

This appendix lists additional resources and tools by module topic.
This list will surely be incomplete, as technology innovation is
dynamic and open approaches are being refined in new DPG use cases.

We look forward to [your
recommendations](contributing.md#contributing-to-the-digital-public-goods-toolkit)
of new resources and tools you've found particularly useful in your
DPG project!


## Resources and Tools: Introduction 

**Engaging Open Source Networks**

**FUTURE WORK**: It would be great to offer some information here on
how to find associations or networks for open source, and how to
access global networks if local ones are not strong yet.  There are so
many resources out there.  Note that in the
[introduction](introduction.md#introduction), we already offer the
advice to look in [Appendix: Resources and
Tools](appendix-resources-tools.md#appendix-resources-and-tools) for
some suggestions on this.  In Europe, there is the [Open Source
Observatory](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor).
But it would be good to present similar resources for Africa, South
America, India, and Southeast Asia.

You might also start by connecting with your local university,
especially if there's a computer science or data science program.
Open source and open data are also heavily relied upon in other
disciplines, like physics and public policy programs and business
schools.  [DHIS2's early focus on building academic and regional
networks](
https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/the-transformative-role-of-academia-digital-public-goods/)
is a great example here.  Academic institutions are another source of
useful national and international networks.  You're also likely to
find talent and support at any sort of commercial start-up accelerator
or incubator, which if not physically local might still be accessible
and helpful to you online.

**Benefits of Open Source**

* The World Bank report [Open Source for Global Public
  Goods](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33401)
  (2019) gives an overview of the benefits of open source, along with
  sensible operational advice -- especially for those working in
  resource-constrained environments -- and a few case studies around
  Identification for Development (ID4D).  It reiterates many of the
  same points we note here, such the benefits of open APIs and a
  modular architecture.

* Benefits are also highlighted in the article [Open Source Software
  Finds its Sweet Spot in the Public
  Sector](https://www.publicsectorexecutive.com/Public-sector-focus/open-source-software-finds-its-sweet-spot-in-the-public-sector-).

**General How-To Guides**

* The [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net),
  listed as a DPG itself, "gives public organizations a model for
  building their own open-source solutions to enable successful future
  reuse by similar public organizations in other places.  It includes
  guidance for policy makers, city administrators, developers and
  vendors." It lists straightforward tips, from how to welcome new
  contributors to the importance of maintaining version control, and
  also includes links to good additional resources.

* [Federal Source Code
  Toolkit](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-open-source-toolkit): This
  is a United States government-wide project facilitated by the
  Code.gov team to produce "how to" documentation pertaining to
  federal source code and open-source software.  It provides guidance
  to agencies for creating and maintaining federal source code
  inventories and open-source repositories.  It's a mix of high-level
  and very specific tips and includes links to good additional
  resources.


## Resources and Tools: Community

**Project Archetypes**

This [2018 slide presentation of project
archetypes](https://opentechstrategies.com/files/presentations/2018-finos/finos-presentation.html)
is a useful short summary of the concept.  Use your keyboard arrows to
move through the slides.

**Community Health**

Mozilla, the non-profit managed company behind the Firefox web browser
and other open, web-focused products, recently published a [report on
its numerous, varied contributor
communities](https://report.mozilla.community) (see the .pdf version).
This report posits a vision for comprehensively understanding
open-source health, following a rather academic approach called the 
[Open Source Ecosystem Health Operationalization
(OSEHO) framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261715766_Measuring_the_Health_of_Open_Source_Software_Ecosystems_Beyond_the_Scope_of_Project_Health), 
and applies an
abbreviated version across its main communities.  The network analysis
visualizations in this report are particularly powerful.

For those who want to go deeper into community health, we recommend a review of 
this OSHEO framework. 
Talking through the paper's understanding of broader project ecosystems -- noting 
that project health does not necessarily equate with ecosystem health -- can be 
particularly useful to teams looking to build an open-source product whose 
success in adoption and contribution depends on a broader ecosystem. 

**Creating your own open-source community**

There's a rich set of online materials about how to create and nurture
a thriving open-source community.  Some of our favorites include:

* The EU's [Guidelines for Sustainable Open Source Communities in the
  Public
  Sector](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Guidelines%20for%20Sustainable%20OSS%20Communities%20in%20the%20Public%20Sector%20final.pdf)
  (2020).  This aligns with the recommendations covered here, from a
  needs and readiness assessment to planning for long term
  sustainability.  It also includes a lits of key considerations to
  building your own open-source community.

* [Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free
  Software Project](https://producingoss.com/en/index.html) reviews
  the nuts and bolts of starting an open-source project, as does the
  TODO Group's [Starting an Open Source
  Project](https://todogroup.org/guides/starting/).  RedHat's
  [Guidebook for open-source community management: The Open Source Way
  2.0](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/guidebook-open-source-community-management-open-source-way-20)
  is another general guide that also includes a 'Community 101'
  primer.
   
* The Mozilla Foundation's [Open Leadership Training
  Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/)
  includes some particuarly useful tips about understanding and
  building to contributor types, or personas.  Remember, your
  community is not necessarily all about coding!  Community members
  can write documentation, localize content, answer questions and
  provide product support (Mozilla's product support is largely
  volunteer-driven), help you market the product or service, and more.

* The [Open Source Guide to Building Welcoming Open Source
  Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) does just
  what the title suggests and dives more deeply into some of the
  niceties around community building (and includes guides to related
  topics like governance and leadership).  The TODO Group has
  published a similar guide, [Building an Inclusive Open Source
  Community](https://todogroup.org/guides/diversity-inclusion/).

* Crowdsourcing data collection can also require attention to
  community development and management, such as for volunteers
  collecting data or managing other data preparation and maintenance
  tasks.  In order to help its volunteer communities around languages
  and voice data grow quickly and independently, the open-source, open-data
  project Common Voice published a ['community
  playbook'](https://common-voice.github.io/community-playbook).  This
  guidance helps Mozilla track data collection around the globe and
  ensure high quality while letting independent, local efforts grow
  without much centralized control.
  
  Unfortunately, participants in online communities exhibit the same
  destructive behavior we see in the physical world.  Marginalized,
  vulnerable community members are most frequently targeted.  Clear
  community participation guidelines can help fend off some of these
  behaviors, and their *enforcement* builds trust within a community.
  
* [Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines
  (CPG)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)
  is a great model to consider copying for your own open-source
  project.  Mozilla's CPG is based on existing best practices and a
  good amount of hands-on experience and research into creating more
  inclusive contributor communities.  Note that it includes a clear
  structure for reporting problematic community behavior and what to
  expect as part of this process.
  
* The DPG OpenMRS has a good [code of
  conduct](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/OpenMRS+Code+of+Conduct)
  that they adapted from the Ubuntu open-source project.  [Mozilla's
  2020 analysis of its contributor
  communities](https://report.mozilla.community/assets/report/Mozilla-Rebel-Alliance-Report-2020.pdf)
  also provides insight into how to support diversity and inclusion.
  
* Lastly, the freely available and widely adopted [Contributor
  Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct has
  been translated into almost three dozen languages.

Don't be put off by the thorough guides we cite above and feel that
managing an open-source project requires significant investment in
community development and governance.  Deep investment isn't necessary
for every project type.  For those where it makes sense, you should
approach community development in phases and 'right size' investment
to what's needed.

For example, the DPG [AIAgro's machine learning
algorithms](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/AI-Agro) are available on
GitHub, with a simple overview of their project on that makes it clear
what they plan to work on, how to contribute, and how to join the
community discussion on Discourse.  If we had to peg this as an
archetype, it's probably most akin to the Rocketship to Mars type.  They're
open to anyone participating, but they're unlikely to invest in bringing people 
onbaord unless they are clearly aligned and have needed skills. They are following
open-source best practices in order to create trust around their product, but 
they don't need to build for a broader
mass audience.

As another example, the DPG Primero created a [global, inter-agency
governance
structure](https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/946/file/Primero.pdf)
only when the platform had matured enough to merit such formalized
oversight.  The OpenSRP DPG publishes a very readable, straightforward
[overview of how its governance, contribution process, and community
management work](https://smartregister.org/governance-structure/).

For those projects that are mature or require significant community
development and would thus benefit from a community manager, note also
that a community manager's role can be more broadly defined to include
adjacent work like documentation, running trainings, and managing key
partners, as well as typical community management tasks like ensuring
new contributors can find appropriate work to do.  For an example, see
a [recent job posting for a community
manager](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/join-our-team/project-community-engagement-coordinator.html)
from the the team behind the Kobo Toolbox DPG (accessed Sept. 2021).

**Clear guidance around *how* to contribute and what the project is looking 
for with contributions** is as important as community governance and management.  
The UNICEF Innovation team maintains a [public repository of best practices and 
resources](https://github.com/unicef/inventory) around working 'openly' in creating 
and managing digital public goods that includes some tips on how to write good 
contributor guidelines to help direct participants into your project's particular 
needs and workflow. It also includes some tips on documentation, which, again, is 
another area for community contribution.


**Regarding external financing, the [Guidelines for Funding Open
Source Software
Development](https://www.archesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guidelines_funding_OSS.pdf])
was written with an audience of public and private foundations in
mind** and will give you a good sense of what many funders are likely
to look for in a proposal that includes open-source software
development.  Many of the points in these guidelines also show up in
practical recommendations in this paper, but you might still benefit
from glancing at this as you plan for your DPG.


## Resources and Tools: Policy

**Integrated Policy Approaches**

The World Bank pubished a background paper [Estonian e-Government
Ecosystem: Foundation, Applications,
Outcomes](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/165711456838073531-0050022016/original/WDR16BPEstonianeGovecosystemVassil.pdf)
that's a thorough overview of the integrated factors -- policies,
institutions, technologies and more -- that helped Estonia create a
successful e-government service ecosystem.

**Public Domain**

The Open Source Initiative provides a simple explanation of the
[problems of public domain
software](https://opensource.org/faq#public-domain)

**Trademark**

The UNICEF Innovation team's [repository of best practices and 
resources](https://github.com/unicef/inventory) expands on our description of the  
[relationship between open source and trademark protection](https://github.com/unicef/inventory/blob/main/content/legal-policy/trademark.en.adoc) and includes a brief case study and links to useful 
trademark policies and additional readings. We particularly like the Linux Foundation's 
tips on how to create a trademark program to encourage compatibile, 'conforming' 
products. (Note that conforming does not automatically equate with certification, 
which requires 
an higher level of scrutiny and testing and -- for most jursicitions - an additional 
set of legal requirements).
 

**Security**

It's a given truth -- unfortunately borne out by real world evidence
-- that computing systems can never be fully secure.  This is true not
only becuase of how software (and hardware) works but also because of
the economics of the IT industry, misaligned incentives and
externalities, little liability for vendors, human nature, the
complexity of today's systems, and so much more.  *Secrets and Lies:
Digital Security in a Networked World* (2000), by renouned security
expert Bruce Schneier, is a good dive into why security is hard.  The
OECD's recent report, [Understanding the digital security of products:
An in-depth
analysis](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/understanding-the-digital-security-of-products_abea0b69-en),
provides a timely overview of the "dynamics that shape the digital
security of products in various markets", especially the dynamics
across the value chain behind digital products.  It also outlines
suggested responses for policy makers, some of which make sense at an
agency level.  It's an excellent paper and recommended reading.

The paper [Threats, Risks, and Mitigations in the Open Source
Ecosystem](https://github.com/ossf/wg-identifying-security-threats/blob/main/publications/threats-risks-mitigations/v1.1/Threats%2C%20Risks%2C%20and%20Mitigations%20in%20the%20Open%20Source%20Ecosystem%20-%20v1.1.pdf)
is a great overview of how to think about security from the
perspective of an open-source ecosystem (here, they use ecosystem to
describe the set of things that comprise a specific open-source
project, such as developers, end users, technical architecture, and
package libraries).

Regarding the ongoing conversation over security and open source
versus closed source, we like David Wheeler's much noted
[essay](https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html).
Bruce Schneier has also [written frequently on the same
topic](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/12/open-source-does-not-equal-secure.html).

The Open Source Security Foundation publishes [free EdX
courses](https://openssf.org/edx-courses) on best practices in
developing secure software and hosts a [related open
community](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developer).

Similar to the Principles for Digital Development on Privacy and
Security](https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security/),
the Open Reference Architecture for Security and Privacy lists its own
set of [key
principles](https://security-and-privacy-reference-architecture.readthedocs.io/en/latest/08-security-principles.html)
along with a list of FOSS security and privacy
applications.(https://security-and-privacy-reference-architecture.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-sbbs.html)

A few **security questionnaires** we've come across that you might find useful 
as you evaluate working with vendors include: 

* Although this [security
  questionnaire](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/rfq/SoNJ%20Third-Party%20Information%20Security%20Questionnaire%20v1.0.pdf)
  is from the state of New Jersey in the United States and references
  local and national laws, it's extremely comprehensive and is still a
  useful model.

* [Google publishes several security
  questionnaires](https://vsaq-demo.withgoogle.com) that are also
  supported by an adaptable [interactive questionnaire
  application](https://github.com/google/vsaq).

* The United States National Institute for Standards and Techology
  (NIST) publishes a [security testing technical
  guide](https://www.nist.gov/publications/technical-guide-information-security-testing-and-assessment)
  that gives an "overview of key elements of technical security
  testing and examination, with an emphasis on specific technical
  techniques, the benefits and limitations of each, and
  recommendations for their use."

* [SAFETAG](https://safetag.org) is a security auditing framework and
  evaluation template aimed at advocacy groups that might be more
  'right sized' for capacity limited DPGs.

* As noted in the paper, the DPG [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) pared
  down several well documented and well used security standards, to
  create a [security
  assessment](https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-20-413.html)
  that made more sense for their on-the-ground circumstances.  The
  report is a good overview of that process and the results.

Also as noted in the paper, the [UNDP's guidance note "Managing Risks
Across UNDP Programming and
Operations"](https://info.undp.org/sites/ERM/Shared%20Documents/UNDP%20ERM%20Guide_Sept2019.pdf)
is a useful reference, aimed at helping its programming and
operational staff manage risk across the UNDP enterprise.

Lastly, some thoughts on **cultural and security considerations when coding in 
the open**.

It's important to think through the cultural shifts required for an
open project to succeed.  Regulation, policies and processes can set
the boundaries of an environment and influence behaviour, but the
execution is still up to individual human choice.

open-source co-development often requires new tools and processes, and
that change must be supported by the organization's culture.  At its
heart, open-source collaboration requires communicating and coding in
the open.  This transparency brings the benefits outlined throughout
this document, but it also opens the project -- and its human
participants -- to feeling vulnerable to more criticism and being
called out more easily for mistakes.  open-source collaboration can be
a significant change for a team or organization (recall our
recommendation to consider if there is a low-risk project you can take
on as an 'primer' open-source experiment!).  Recognize that change
feels like a loss to many -- a loss of stability and what they knew
about how to work -- and they will need leadership and guidance.  Be
sure to keep conversations going in your team about how well your
organizational culture supports their needs.

One of the greatest fears of many developers is to jeopardize a
project's security and potentially harm real people.  Many might worry
that open-source code is itself a security vulnerability.  What if a
mistake is made in the open? How can an agency decide what code should
stay proprietary because of security concerns?

The UK government has publicly wrangled with these issues and come up
with useful guidance.  It's notable that their stance on how much code
to develop through an open-source model has changed from "most" to
"all, with very limited exceptions".  In short, their experience
taught them that open sourcing code was actually a great way to
confirm and enhance security, perhaps even particularly for code
related to managing security.  When following and enforcing [strong
security
design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles),
such as ensuring configuration files are kept separately from code,
they found that open peer review improves security.

The UK's guidance [Security Considerations When Coding in the
Open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open)
is a concise, clear checklist for developers and program managers that
links to other useful resources, such as how to manage software
dependencies and the value of automated style enforcement.  These
checklist items include:

* Open the code early
* Don't rely on closed code as your only security measure
* Follow good development practices
* Keep keys and credentials closed
* Assume accidental publications are compromised
* Deal with security vulnerabilities

Their [approach to when code should be kept
closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed)
is similarly straightforward:

* Data and code related to keys and credentials
* Algorithms used to detect fraud
* Unreleased policy should be kept closed


## Resources and Tools: Adoptability

The [Open Source Maturity
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource_Maturity_Model) is
another way of evaluating an open-source product for adoption.  It
covers the same points we review in the paper, but it has more of a
process-oriented approach that also includes scoring and weighting.
More background is in this article by Bernard Golden in [Technology
Innovation Management Review](https://timreview.ca/article/145), (May
2008).


## Resources and Tools: Procurement

This [panel discussion about agile development and modular
contracts](https://www.agilegovleaders.org/watch-agl-live-wild-wild-west-managing-agile-contracts-in-government/)
includes public sector employees from the state of California and 18F,
discussing great insights about the challenges and lessons learned in
their revamp of California's Child Welfare digital system.
